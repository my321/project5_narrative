       "'following is the transcript of senator hillary rodham clintons remarks at the council on foreign relations as provided by cq transcriptions incclinton you all know the litany of threats and challenges the metastasizing threat of terrorists networks recruiting troops setting up training camps amassing weapons a regime in north korea openly testing missiles and nuclear weapons an activist expansionist iran pursuing its own nuclear arsenal a resurgent taliban in afghanistanand an emerging civil war in iraq russia and china pursuing their own interests often at odds with such global imperatives as nuclear nonproliferation and ending genocide in darfur oil has never been more important in funding unstable anti american governments and yet we have failed to make the investments necessary to move more rapidly to alternative fuels a policy that is now as important to our national security and our mideast strategy as to our economy and environment the lost opportunities of the years since september th are the stuff of tragedy remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of tehran the famous headline we are all americans now five years later much of the world wonders what america is now as we face this landscape of failure and disorder nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests increase our security and advance our values it could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged a decent respect for the opinions of mankind in the declaration of independence i think its fair to say we are now all internationalists and we are all realists this administrations choices were false ones internationalism versus unilateralism realism versus idealism is there really any argument that america must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals the american character is both idealistic and realistic why cant our government reflect that i want to suggest three principles i believe should underlie a bipartisan consensus on national security and consider how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face first and most obviously we must by word and deed renew internationalism for a new century we did not face world war ii alone we did not face the cold war alone and we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone either a terrorist cell may recruit in southeast asia train in central asia find funds in the middle east and plan attacks in the us or europe we can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hop scotches from continent to continent or we can wait until it arrives at our own doors we can deal with climate change together now or excuse its calamitous consequences later we can turn our back on international institutions or we can modernize and revitalize them and when needed get about the hard work of creating new ones second we must value diplomacy as well as a strong military we should not hesitate to engage in the worlds most difficult conflicts on a diplomatic front we cannot leave the middle east to solve itself or avoid direct talks with north korea when faced with an existential challenge to the life of our nation president kennedy said let us never negotiate from fear but let us never fear to negotiate direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness theyre a sign of leadership third our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of american interests if theres one idea that has been floated about over the last six years that i would like to see debunked with all due respect to some of the political scientists in the room it is this false choice between realism and idealism is it realist or idealist to stop nuclear proliferation is it realist or idealist to come together on global warming is it realist or idealist to help developing nations educate their children fight diseases and grow their economies and is it realist or idealist to believe we must turn around the ideology underpinning terrorism strategies with respect to all of the problems we face require a mix of both and each requires building that consensus approach that we then have to do the hard work of bringing others to our side we cannot achieve any of the solutions that we need to be pursuing without american leadership and we cannot achieve any of them alone american foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests and in an increasingly interdependent world it is in our interests to stand for human rights to promote religious freedom democracy womens rights social justice and economic empowerment but reality informs us we cannot force others  nations and peoples  to accept those values we have to support those who embrace them and lead by example at our best americans have always lived in a creative tension between idealism and realism between our cleareyed insistence on seeing the world as it actually is and our deeply held desire to remake the world as it ought to be this administration has abandoned that tension for a simplistic division of the world into good and evil theyve refused to talk to anyone on the evil side and some have called that idealistic i call it dangerously unrealistic at the end of the day you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism something is wrong when our pursuit of idealistic goals has turned a good portion of the world against us earlier this year a progressive and conservative anatol lieven and john hulsman wrote a book together called ethical realism you dont have to accept all of their policy proposals to learn something from the common ground they found they remind us of a time when americas leading protestant theologian reinhold niebuhr cautioned us against believing that god was on our side of a time when president dwight david eisenhower rejected rhetoric about a preemptive attack on the soviet union by asking among other things the practical question of how we would occupy the vast country if we won of a time when the editor of foreign affairs invited a littleknown diplomat named george kennan to publish an article an anonymous article that established the bipartisan foundation of our cold war foreign policy in every era we wrestle with how to reconcile the pragmatic with the moral elements of our strength and what we choose to do with both we got it right mostly during the cold war when realists and idealists together built the institutions and policies serving our interests and our values we got it drastically wrong when a small group of ideologues decided we didnt need those institutions or alliances or diplomacy or even the respect of other nations these principles would force a sea change from the current administrations policies if you look at the dangerous situations we face today in iraq afghanistan iran north korea the proliferation of deadly weapons the prosecution of the war on terror you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over the mistaken belief that alliances international institutions all of that irrelevant to american interests the mistaken belief that diplomacy even if backed by force is synonymous with weakness the mistaken belief that our militarys experience in war planning our intelligence communitys objective analysis and our diplomats experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking and in iraq the mistake of waging a preemptive war based on faulty intelligence fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a onetimeonly doctrine with no deterrent effect we need to return to patient diplomacy backed by military strength and informed by american values let me start with iraq because in human terms this has been a horrible month we mourn the loss of more than  american servicemembers and many hundreds more iraq in political terms we have finally reached the point of complete absurdity the administration announces it will propose timetables or benchmarks and the iraq prime minister denounces them bush says we are adjusting tactics but secretary rumsfeld insists we are staying the course the administration tells iran and syria theyre responsible for helping to keep the peace but wont talk with them about how to do it we continue to deny evident reality proceeding with few  or no  allies and precious little direct communication with people who matter no wonder the american people think we are adrift we need a fundamental change in course and i believe there are three basic parts to that first we need to press consistently privately and publicly the iraq to become serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution and present real consequences for their failing to do so only the iraq government can take action to create the condition for a political settlement instead the government in recent days seems to be going out of its way to rebuff our efforts to move in that direction american credibility is held hostage by an iraq government that will not fulfill its pledge to seek a political resolution of the rights and roles of the sunni minority and to determine how oil revenue is allocated for several years  actually since the summer of   i have pushed the idea that we should establish in iraq an oil trust guaranteeing that every individual iraq would share part of the countrys oil wealth every year instead the oil distribution remains unsettled sunnis have no incentive to stop fighting kurds have no incentive to operate within iraq and shiites have no incentive to stop participating in militias and internecine conflict guaranteeing every iraq a share of the oil revenues at the individual level is one way to try to begin to move beyond the impasse and to give iraq some reason to believe number one we arent there for oil we arent there to support big oil we arent there to line the pockets of the new iraq elite and fatten their swiss bank accounts and to give the iraq also some reason to feel positive about their national government second we do need what many of us have been calling for now for months even years at this point a public international conference of the parties in the region  the turks the saudis egyptians the emirates the jordanians but also the syrians and iranians we need to put everybody on the record as to whether they will make public commitments to respect iraqs sovereignty and to further the task of iraqs stability instead of fearing to negotiate we should fear what happens if we never attempt to negotiate a regional commitment to a stable unified iraq and also iraqs neighbors should fear that as well they would bear the bracet of an allout civil war including millions of fleeing refugees and new bases for regional terrorist operations and thirdly we do need to begin  i had hoped by the end of this year  a phased redeployment i joined with senators levin and reed and the democrat leadership in the senate and the house in proposing a phased redeployment of us troops from iraq during this year  that would also include a change in the mission of us forces to one of training and supporting iraq troops and targeting counterterrorism  clinton thank you all'"
