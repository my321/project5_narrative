       "\"Following is the transcript of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.CLINTON: You all know the litany of threats and challenges: the metastasizing threat of terrorists networks recruiting troops, setting up training camps, amassing weapons; a regime in North Korea openly testing missiles and nuclear weapons; an activist, expansionist Iran pursuing its own nuclear arsenal; a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan;and an emerging civil war in Iraq; Russia and China pursuing their own interests, often at odds with such global imperatives as nuclear nonproliferation; and ending genocide in Darfur. Oil has never been more important in funding unstable, anti- American governments and yet we have failed to make the investments necessary to move more rapidly to alternative fuels, a policy that is now as important to our national security and our Mideast strategy as to our economy and environment. The lost opportunities of the years since September 11th are the stuff of tragedy. Remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of Tehran; the famous headline, We are all Americans now. Five years later, much of the world wonders what America is now. As we face this landscape of failure and disorder, nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests, increase our security and advance our values. It could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged a decent respect for the opinions of mankind in the Declaration of Independence. I think it's fair to say we are now all internationalists and we are all realists. This administration's choices were false ones: internationalism versus unilateralism, realism versus idealism. Is there really any argument that America must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom, and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals? The American character is both idealistic and realistic. Why can't our government reflect that? I want to suggest three principles I believe should underlie a bipartisan consensus on national security, and consider how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face. First, and most obviously, we must by word and deed renew internationalism for a new century. We did not face World War II alone. We did not face the Cold War alone. And we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone either. A terrorist cell may recruit in Southeast Asia, train in Central Asia, find funds in the Middle East and plan attacks in the U.S. or Europe. We can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hop- scotches from continent to continent, or we can wait until it arrives at our own doors. We can deal with climate change together now or excuse its calamitous consequences later. We can turn our back on international institutions or we can modernize and revitalize them and, when needed, get about the hard work of creating new ones. Second, we must value diplomacy as well as a strong military. We should not hesitate to engage in the world's most difficult conflicts on a diplomatic front. We cannot leave the Middle East to solve itself, or avoid direct talks with North Korea. When faced with an existential challenge to the life of our nation, President Kennedy said, Let us never negotiate from fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness; they're a sign of leadership. Third, our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of American interests. If there's one idea that has been floated about over the last six years that I would like to see debunked, with all due respect to some of the political scientists in the room, it is this false choice between realism and idealism. Is it realist or idealist to stop nuclear proliferation? Is it realist or idealist to come together on global warming? Is it realist or idealist to help developing nations educate their children, fight diseases and grow their economies? And is it realist or idealist to believe we must turn around the ideology underpinning terrorism? Strategies with respect to all of the problems we face require a mix of both, and each requires building that consensus approach; that we then have to do the hard work of bringing others to our side. We cannot achieve any of the solutions that we need to be pursuing without American leadership and we cannot achieve any of them alone. American foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests. And in an increasingly interdependent world, it is in our interests to stand for human rights, to promote religious freedom, democracy, women's rights, social justice and economic empowerment. But reality informs us we cannot force others -- nations and peoples -- to accept those values. We have to support those who embrace them, and lead by example. At our best, Americans have always lived in a creative tension between idealism and realism, between our clear-eyed insistence on seeing the world as it actually is and our deeply held desire to remake the world as it ought to be. This administration has abandoned that tension for a simplistic division of the world into good and evil. They've refused to talk to anyone on the evil side and some have called that idealistic. I call it dangerously unrealistic. At the end of the day, you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism. Something is wrong when our pursuit of idealistic goals has turned a good portion of the world against us. Earlier this year, a progressive and conservative, Anatol Lieven and John Hulsman, wrote a book together called Ethical Realism. You don't have to accept all of their policy proposals to learn something from the common ground they found. They remind us of a time when America's leading Protestant theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, cautioned us against believing that God was on our side; of a time when President Dwight David Eisenhower rejected rhetoric about a preemptive attack on the Soviet Union by asking, among other things, the practical question of how we would occupy the vast country if we won; of a time when the editor of Foreign Affairs invited a little-known diplomat named George Kennan to publish an article, an anonymous article, that established the bipartisan foundation of our Cold War foreign policy. In every era, we wrestle with how to reconcile the pragmatic with the moral elements of our strength and what we choose to do with both. We got it right, mostly, during the Cold War, when realists and idealists, together, built the institutions and policies serving our interests and our values. We got it drastically wrong when a small group of ideologues decided we didn't need those institutions or alliances or diplomacy or even the respect of other nations. These principles would force a sea change from the current administration's policies. If you look at the dangerous situations we face today in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, the proliferation of deadly weapons, the prosecution of the war on terror, you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over. The mistaken belief that alliances, international institutions, all of that irrelevant to American interests; the mistaken belief that diplomacy, even if backed by force, is synonymous with weakness; the mistaken belief that our military's experience in war planning, our intelligence community's objective analysis and our diplomats' experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking; and in Iraq, the mistake of waging a preemptive war based on faulty intelligence, fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a one-time-only doctrine, with no deterrent effect. We need to return to patient diplomacy, backed by military strength and informed by American values. Let me start with Iraq, because in human terms this has been a horrible month. We mourn the loss of more than 100 American servicemembers and many hundreds more Iraqis. In political terms, we have finally reached the point of complete absurdity. The administration announces it will propose timetables or benchmarks and the Iraqi prime minister denounces them. President Bush says we are adjusting tactics, but Secretary Rumsfeld insists we are staying the course. The administration tells Iran and Syria they're responsible for helping to keep the peace, but won't talk with them about how to do it. We continue to deny evident reality, proceeding with few -- or no -- allies and precious little direct communication with people who matter. No wonder the American people think we are adrift. We need a fundamental change in course, and I believe there are three basic parts to that. First, we need to press consistently, privately and publicly the Iraqis to become serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution and present real consequences for their failing to do so. Only the Iraqi government can take action to create the condition for a political settlement. Instead, the government in recent days seems to be going out of its way to rebuff our efforts to move in that direction. American credibility is held hostage by an Iraqi government that will not fulfill its pledge to seek a political resolution of the rights and roles of the Sunni minority and to determine how oil revenue is allocated. For several years -- actually since the summer of 2003 -- I have pushed the idea that we should establish in Iraq an oil trust, guaranteeing that every individual Iraqi would share part of the country's oil wealth every year. Instead, the oil distribution remains unsettled. Sunnis have no incentive to stop fighting, Kurds have no incentive to operate within Iraq, and Shiites have no incentive to stop participating in militias and internecine conflict. Guaranteeing every Iraqi a share of the oil revenues at the individual level is one way to try to begin to move beyond the impasse and to give Iraqis some reason to believe, number one, we aren't there for oil; we aren't there to support big oil; we aren't there to line the pockets of the new Iraqi elite and fatten their Swiss bank accounts; and to give the Iraqis, also, some reason to feel positive about their national government. Second, we do need what many of us have been calling for now for months, even years at this point: a public international conference of the parties in the region -- the Turks, the Saudis, Egyptians, the Emirates, the Jordanians, but also the Syrians and Iranians. We need to put everybody on the record as to whether they will make public commitments to respect Iraq's sovereignty and to further the task of Iraq's stability. Instead of fearing to negotiate, we should fear what happens if we never attempt to negotiate a regional commitment to a stable, unified Iraq. And also Iraq's neighbors should fear that as well. They would bear the brunt of an all-out civil war, including millions of fleeing refugees and new bases for regional terrorist operations. And thirdly, we do need to begin -- I had hoped by the end of this year -- a phased redeployment. I joined with Senators Levin and Reed and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and the House in proposing a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq during this year, 2006. That would also include a change in the mission of U.S. forces to one of training and supporting Iraqi troops and targeting counterterrorism  CLINTON: Thank you all. \""

       " \"People in the Democratic Party who have been focused on social issues like abortion and gay rights were devastated by the results of the November election, and they have been wondering how to pursue their concerns in the inhospitable environment of the new Bush administration. Last week, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton helped define a promising path.    Speaking on Monday to about 1,000 abortion rights supporters in Albany, Mrs. Clinton did two important things. First, at a moment when women's reproductive freedom is under severe assault, she firmly restated her support for Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. What made Mrs. Clinton's speech noteworthy, however, was her second, complementary tack. Without retreating on principle, she deftly shifted the focus of the abortion discussion to where there is the broadest agreement, and where President Bush's policy failure is most apparent -- namely, abortion prevention. Echoing her husband's call to make abortion ''safe, legal and rare,'' the senator said that abortion ''represents a sad, even tragic choice to many, many women,'' and that ''the best way to reduce the number of abortions is to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies in the first place.''  \",\n",

       " \"FROM the outside, the Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater looks more like a meeting place for Cape Cod lobstermen than an institution applauded by theater critics. On summer evenings, sailors dock at the adjacent town pier and line up at Mac's Seafood, which serves fried clams and onion rings so large it's hard to believe they came from an actual vegetable. Inside the tiny theater, which seats fewer than a hundred and smells vaguely like sea air, actors can only enter from stage right because the women's room is so close to stage left that they would essentially have to enter from the bathroom.     Yet the theater has gained a reputation for productions far more sophisticated than typical summer stock -- it has offered New England premieres of works by Sam Shepard and Eve Ensler and has won the New England version of a Tony award, an Elliot Norton, for its role in fostering serious theater on the cape. Earlier this year, Wellfleet Harbor presented the debut of a caustic political farce by Robert Reich, the Clinton administration's labor secretary, about an argumentative right-wing television anchor who runs for president against a Hillary Rodham Clinton look-alike who turns out to be a hermaphrodite. In Mr. Reich's world, the hermaphrodite wins by appealing to both male and female voters.  \",\n",

       " \"Andrew von Eschenbach, the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, seems ready to approve nonprescription use of the morning-after pill after more than two years of unconscionable delays by his predecessors. But skeptical Democratic senators are right to threaten to block a confirmation vote on Dr. von Eschenbach as permanent commissioner until the agency actually decides whether the morning-after regimen can be made available without prescription, at least for women ages 18 and older. Senators Hillary Clinton of New York and Patty Murray of Washington were snookered once when they accepted a written assurance by the Bush administration that a decision would be made soon -- only to find out later that the decision was to keep deferring the decision.     The most encouraging element in Dr. von Eschenbach's new stance, announced on the eve of his confirmation hearing, was his willingness to shuck a proposed rule-making process that could have gummed up the issue for many months. Instead, he invited the manufacturer to enter direct talks quickly on all questions that stand in the way of approval. The main sticking point is how the company can be sure its plan to keep the pills out of the hands of young girls -- by limiting sales to pharmacies that agree to hold the drug behind the counter and to require proof of age -- will work in practice.  \",\n",

       " \" I MIGHT    The News -- Will he or won't he? His answer has always been a seemingly decided won't. But last Sunday Barack Obama said he would consider considering a run for the presidency in 2008.    Behind the News -- Speculation has tracked the freshman senator from Illinois since his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. Mr. Obama has routinely deflected such speculation, saying that he would finish his term before acting on any further ambitions. But on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' last week, he said: ''I don't want to be coy about this: given the responses that I've been getting over the last several months, I have thought about the possibility, but I have not thought about it with the seriousness and depth that I think is required.''  The shift puts Mr. Obama squarely in the path of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.    I DIDN'T    The News -- The Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, said on Wednesday that he had not agreed to a timetable for stabilizing Iraq.    Behind the News -- A day earlier, the top two United States officials in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr. and Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, announced such a timetable for political measures and said it had been approved by the Iraqi government. If that was a bluff, it was called when Mr. Maliki said, ''I want to stress that this is a government of the people's will, and no one has the right to set a timetable for it.     The ambassador and the general, of course, were addressing themselves primarily to an American audience, while Mr. Maliki had his own Iraqi audience to attend to.    I MEANT    The News -- The Daily News reported that John Spencer, who is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton for her Senate seat from New York, disparaged her looks and suggested that she had paid millions to improve them. Mr. Spencer called the report a ''complete fabrication,'' but then acknowledged that he had talked about Mrs. Clinton's changing style in the context of ''everyone looking different'' as they age.    Behind the News -- Mr. Spencer denied having called Mrs. Clinton unattractive in his impromptu interview with The Daily News, but a columnist for The Journal News in Westchester County said that in a separate conversation, Mr. Spencer said, ''words to the effect of, 'Well, you know me, words slip out, but I won't call her a lesbian or anything.' '' Mr. Spencer did distance himself from that remark. Rob Ryan, his spokesman, said, ''If he offended anyone, he apologizes.''    I ERRED    The News -- Rush Limbaugh told radio listeners that Michael J. Fox exaggerated symptoms of his Parkinson's disease in a television ad for Democrats who support embryonic stem-cell research.

All right then, I stand corrected  so I will bigly, hugely admit that I was wrong, and I will apologize to Michael J. Fox, if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act.'' Mr. Fox, who played an archconservative young Republican in the 80's sitcom ''Family Ties,'' is just ''shilling for a Democratic politician,'' Mr. Limbaugh said after his ''bigly'' apology. Mr. Fox, though, has also supported a Republican, Senator Arlen Specter, on stem cells.\",\n",
       " \"Following is the transcript of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.CLINTON: You all know the litany of threats and challenges: the metastasizing threat of terrorists networks recruiting troops, setting up training camps, amassing weapons; a regime in North Korea openly testing missiles and nuclear weapons; an activist, expansionist Iran pursuing its own nuclear arsenal; a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan;and an emerging civil war in Iraq; Russia and China pursuing their own interests, often at odds with such global imperatives as nuclear nonproliferation; and ending genocide in Darfur. Oil has never been more important in funding unstable, anti- American governments and yet we have failed to make the investments necessary to move more rapidly to alternative fuels, a policy that is now as important to our national security and our Mideast strategy as to our economy and environment. The lost opportunities of the years since September 11th are the stuff of tragedy. Remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of Tehran; the famous headline, We are all Americans now. Five years later, much of the world wonders what America is now. As we face this landscape of failure and disorder, nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests, increase our security and advance our values. It could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged a decent respect for the opinions of mankind in the Declaration of Independence. I think it's fair to say we are now all internationalists and we are all realists. This administration's choices were false ones: internationalism versus unilateralism, realism versus idealism. Is there really any argument that America must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom, and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals? The American character is both idealistic and realistic. Why can't our government reflect that? I want to suggest three principles I believe should underlie a bipartisan consensus on national security, and consider how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face. First, and most obviously, we must by word and deed renew internationalism for a new century. We did not face World War II alone. We did not face the Cold War alone. And we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone either. A terrorist cell may recruit in Southeast Asia, train in Central Asia, find funds in the Middle East and plan attacks in the U.S. or Europe. We can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hop- scotches from continent to continent, or we can wait until it arrives at our own doors. We can deal with climate change together now or excuse its calamitous consequences later. We can turn our back on international institutions or we can modernize and revitalize them and, when needed, get about the hard work of creating new ones. Second, we must value diplomacy as well as a strong military. We should not hesitate to engage in the world's most difficult conflicts on a diplomatic front. We cannot leave the Middle East to solve itself, or avoid direct talks with North Korea. When faced with an existential challenge to the life of our nation, President Kennedy said, Let us never negotiate from fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness; they're a sign of leadership. Third, our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of American interests. If there's one idea that has been floated about over the last six years that I would like to see debunked, with all due respect to some of the political scientists in the room, it is this false choice between realism and idealism. Is it realist or idealist to stop nuclear proliferation? Is it realist or idealist to come together on global warming? Is it realist or idealist to help developing nations educate their children, fight diseases and grow their economies? And is it realist or idealist to believe we must turn around the ideology underpinning terrorism? Strategies with respect to all of the problems we face require a mix of both, and each requires building that consensus approach; that we then have to do the hard work of bringing others to our side. We cannot achieve any of the solutions that we need to be pursuing without American leadership and we cannot achieve any of them alone. American foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests. And in an increasingly interdependent world, it is in our interests to stand for human rights, to promote religious freedom, democracy, women's rights, social justice and economic empowerment. But reality informs us we cannot force others -- nations and peoples -- to accept those values. We have to support those who embrace them, and lead by example. At our best, Americans have always lived in a creative tension between idealism and realism, between our clear-eyed insistence on seeing the world as it actually is and our deeply held desire to remake the world as it ought to be. This administration has abandoned that tension for a simplistic division of the world into good and evil. They've refused to talk to anyone on the evil side and some have called that idealistic. I call it dangerously unrealistic. At the end of the day, you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism. Something is wrong when our pursuit of idealistic goals has turned a good portion of the world against us. Earlier this year, a progressive and conservative, Anatol Lieven and John Hulsman, wrote a book together called Ethical Realism. You don't have to accept all of their policy proposals to learn something from the common ground they found. They remind us of a time when America's leading Protestant theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, cautioned us against believing that God was on our side; of a time when President Dwight David Eisenhower rejected rhetoric about a preemptive attack on the Soviet Union by asking, among other things, the practical question of how we would occupy the vast country if we won; of a time when the editor of Foreign Affairs invited a little-known diplomat named George Kennan to publish an article, an anonymous article, that established the bipartisan foundation of our Cold War foreign policy. In every era, we wrestle with how to reconcile the pragmatic with the moral elements of our strength and what we choose to do with both. We got it right, mostly, during the Cold War, when realists and idealists, together, built the institutions and policies serving our interests and our values. We got it drastically wrong when a small group of ideologues decided we didn't need those institutions or alliances or diplomacy or even the respect of other nations. These principles would force a sea change from the current administration's policies. If you look at the dangerous situations we face today in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, the proliferation of deadly weapons, the prosecution of the war on terror, you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over. The mistaken belief that alliances, international institutions, all of that irrelevant to American interests; the mistaken belief that diplomacy, even if backed by force, is synonymous with weakness; the mistaken belief that our military's experience in war planning, our intelligence community's objective analysis and our diplomats' experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking; and in Iraq, the mistake of waging a preemptive war based on faulty intelligence, fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a one-time-only doctrine, with no deterrent effect. We need to return to patient diplomacy, backed by military strength and informed by American values. Let me start with Iraq, because in human terms this has been a horrible month. We mourn the loss of more than 100 American servicemembers and many hundreds more Iraqis. In political terms, we have finally reached the point of complete absurdity. The administration announces it will propose timetables or benchmarks and the Iraqi prime minister denounces them. President Bush says we are adjusting tactics, but Secretary Rumsfeld insists we are staying the course. The administration tells Iran and Syria they're responsible for helping to keep the peace, but won't talk with them about how to do it. We continue to deny evident reality, proceeding with few -- or no -- allies and precious little direct communication with people who matter. No wonder the American people think we are adrift. We need a fundamental change in course, and I believe there are three basic parts to that. First, we need to press consistently, privately and publicly the Iraqis to become serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution and present real consequences for their failing to do so. Only the Iraqi government can take action to create the condition for a political settlement. Instead, the government in recent days seems to be going out of its way to rebuff our efforts to move in that direction. American credibility is held hostage by an Iraqi government that will not fulfill its pledge to seek a political resolution of the rights and roles of the Sunni minority and to determine how oil revenue is allocated. For several years -- actually since the summer of 2003 -- I have pushed the idea that we should establish in Iraq an oil trust, guaranteeing that every individual Iraqi would share part of the country's oil wealth every year. Instead, the oil distribution remains unsettled. Sunnis have no incentive to stop fighting, Kurds have no incentive to operate within Iraq, and Shiites have no incentive to stop participating in militias and internecine conflict. Guaranteeing every Iraqi a share of the oil revenues at the individual level is one way to try to begin to move beyond the impasse and to give Iraqis some reason to believe, number one, we aren't there for oil; we aren't there to support big oil; we aren't there to line the pockets of the new Iraqi elite and fatten their Swiss bank accounts; and to give the Iraqis, also, some reason to feel positive about their national government. Second, we do need what many of us have been calling for now for months, even years at this point: a public international conference of the parties in the region -- the Turks, the Saudis, Egyptians, the Emirates, the Jordanians, but also the Syrians and Iranians. We need to put everybody on the record as to whether they will make public commitments to respect Iraq's sovereignty and to further the task of Iraq's stability. Instead of fearing to negotiate, we should fear what happens if we never attempt to negotiate a regional commitment to a stable, unified Iraq. And also Iraq's neighbors should fear that as well. They would bear the brunt of an all-out civil war, including millions of fleeing refugees and new bases for regional terrorist operations. And thirdly, we do need to begin -- I had hoped by the end of this year -- a phased redeployment. I joined with Senators Levin and Reed and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and the House in proposing a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq during this year, 2006. That would also include a change in the mission of U.S. forces to one of training and supporting Iraqi troops and targeting counterterrorism  CLINTON: Thank you all. \",\n",
