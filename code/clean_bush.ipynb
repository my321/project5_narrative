       "'Following is the transcript of President George W. Bush\\'s news conference on Iraq, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.BUSH: Thank you all very much. I\\'m going to spend a little more time on my opening comments than I usually do, but I\\'ll save plenty of time for questions. Over the past three years, I have often addressed the American people to explain developments in Iraq. Some of these developments were encouraging, such as the capture of Saddam Hussein, the elections in which 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and voted for a free future, and the demise of the brutal terrorist Zarqawi. Other developments were not encouraging, such as the bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, the fact that we did not find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, and the continued loss of some of America\\'s finest sons and daughters. Recently, American and Iraqi forces have launched some of the most aggressive operations on enemy forces in Baghdad since the war began. They have cleared neighborhoods of terrorists and death squads and uncovered large caches of weapons, including sniper scopes and mortars and powerful bombs. There had been heavy fighting. Many enemy fighters had been killed or captured. And we\\'ve suffered casualties of our own. This month we\\'ve lost 93 servicemembers in Iraq; the most since October of 2005. During roughly the same period, more than 300 Iraqi security personnel have given their lives in battle. Iraqi civilians have suffered unspeakable violence at the hands of the terrorists, insurgents, illegal militias, armed groups and criminals. The events of the past month have been a serious concern to me and a serious concern to the American people. Today I will explain how we\\'re adapting our tactics to help the Iraqi government gain control of the security situation. I will also explain why, despite the difficulties and bloodshed, it remains critical that America defeat the enemy in Iraq by helping the Iraqis build a free nation that can sustain itself and defend itself. Our security at home depends on ensuring that Iraq is an ally in the war on terror and does not become a terrorist haven like Afghanistan under the Taliban. The enemy we face in Iraq has evolved over the past three years. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, a sophisticated and violent insurgency took root. Early on, this insurgency was made up of remnants of Saddam Hussein\\'s Baath Party, as well as criminals released by the regime. The insurgency was fueled by Al Qaida and other foreign terrorists who focused most of their attention on high-profile attacks against coalition forces and international institutions. We learned some key lessons from that early phase in the war. We saw how quickly Al Qaida and other extremist groups would come to Iraq to fight and try to drive us out. We overestimated the capability of the civil service in Iraq to continue to provide essential services to the Iraqi people. We did not expect the Iraqi army, including the Republican Guard, to melt away in the way that it did in the face of advancing coalition forces. Despite these early setbacks, some very important progress was made in the midst of an incredibly violent period. Iraqis formed an interim government that assumed sovereignty. The Iraqi people elected a transitional government; drafted and adopted the most progressive democratic constitution in the Arab world; braved the car bombs and assassins to choose a permanent government under that constitution; and slowly began to build a capable national army. Al Qaida and insurgents were unable to stop this progress. They tried to stand up to our forces in places like Fallujah -- and they were routed, so they changed their tactics. In an intercepted letter to Osama bin Laden, the terrorist Zarqawi laid out his strategy to drag Iraq\\'s Shia population into a sectarian war. To the credit of the Shia population, they resisted; responding to the horrific violence against them for a long time. Yet the persistent attacks, particularly last February\\'s bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of the Shia Islam\\'s most holy shrines, eventually resulted in sectarian reprisals. The cycle of violence in which Al Qaida insurgents attacked Shia civilians and Shia death squads retaliated against Sunnis has sharply increased in recent months, particularly in Baghdad. As the enemy shifts tactics, we are shifting our tactics as well. Americans have no intention of taking sides in a sectarian struggle or standing in the crossfire between rival factions. Our mission is to help the elected government in Iraq defeat common enemies, to bring peace and stability to Iraq and make our nation more secure. Our goals are unchanging. We are flexible in our methods to achieving those goals. On the military side, our commanders on the ground are constantly adjusting our tactics to stay ahead of our enemies. We are refining our training strategy for the Iraqi security forces, so we can help more of those forces take the lead in the fight and provide them better equipment and firepower to be successful. We\\'ve increased the number of coalition advisers in the Iraqi ministries of defense and interior, so they can better plan and execute security operations against the enemy. We have changed our force structure so we can better respond to the conditions on the ground. For example, during the Iraqi elections, we increased our force levels to more than 150,000 troops to ensure people could vote. Most recently, we have moved additional coalition and Iraqi forces into Baghdad, so they can help secure the city and reduce sectarian violence. After some initial successes, our operations to secure Baghdad have encountered greater resistance. Some of the Iraqi security forces have performed below expectations. Many have performed well and are fighting bravely in some of Baghdad\\'s toughest neighborhoods. Once again, American troops are performing superbly under very difficult conditions. Together with the Iraqis, they\\'ve conducted hundreds of missions throughout Baghdad. They\\'ve rounded up or killed key insurgents and death squad leaders. As we fight this enemy, we are working with the Iraqi government to perform -- the performance -- to improve the performance of their security forces, so they can regain control of the nation\\'s capital and eventually assume primary responsibility for their country\\'s security. A military solution alone will not stop violence. In the end, the Iraqi people and their government will have to make the difficult decisions necessary to solve these problems. So, in addition to refining our military tactics to defeat the enemy, we\\'re also working to help the Iraqi government achieve a political solution that brings together Shia and Sunni and Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups. Yesterday, our ambassador to Iraq, Zal Khalilzad, laid out a three-step approach. First, we\\'re working with political and religious leaders across Iraq, urging them to take steps to restrain their followers and stop sectarian violence. Second, we\\'re helping Iraqi leaders to complete work on a national compact to resolve the most difficult issues dividing their country. The new Iraqi government has condemned violence from all quarters and agreed to a schedule for resolving issues such as disarming illegal militias and death squads, sharing oil revenues, amending the Iraqi constitution and reforming the de-Baathification process. Third, we are reaching out to Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan, asking them to support the Iraqi government\\'s efforts to persuade Sunni insurgents to lay down their arms and accept national reconciliation. The international community is also supporting the international compact that outlines the support that will be provided to Iraq as it moves forward with its own program of reform. These are difficult tasks for any government. It is important for Americans to recognize that Prime Minister Maliki\\'s unity government has been in office for just over five months. Think about that: This young government has to solve a host of problems created by decades of tyrannical rule, and they have to do it in the midst of raging conflict against extremists from outside and inside the country who are doing everything they can to stop this government from succeeding. We are pressing Iraqi\\'s leaders to take bold measures to save their country. We\\'re making it clear that America\\'s patience is not unlimited. Yet we also understand the difficult challenges Iraq\\'s leaders face. And we will not put more pressure on the Iraqi government than it can bear. The way to succeed in Iraq is to help Iraq\\'s government grow in strength and assume more control over its country as quickly as possible. I know the American people understand the stakes in Iraq. They want to win. They will support the war as long as they see a path to victory. Americans can have confidence that we will prevail because thousands of smart, dedicated military and civilian personnel are risking their lives and are working around the clock to ensure our success. A distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats, led by Former Secretary of State Jim Baker and Former Congressman Lee Hamilton, is taking a fresh look at the situation in Iraq and will make recommendations to help achieve our goals. I welcome all these efforts. My administration will carefully consider any proposal that will help us achieve victory. It\\'s my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. There is tough fighting ahead. The road to victory will not be easy. We should not expect a simple solution. The fact that the fighting is tough does not mean our efforts in Iraq are not worth it. To the contrary, the consequences in Iraq will have a decisive impact on the security of our country, because defeating the terrorists in Iraq is essential to turning back the cause of extremism in the Middle East. If we do not defeat the terrorists or extremists in Iraq, they will gain access to vast oil reserves and use Iraq as a base to overthrow moderate governments across the broader Middle East. They will launch new attacks on America from this new safe haven. They will pursue their goal of a radical Islamic empire that stretches from Spain to Indonesia. I know many Americans are not satisfied with the situation in Iraq. I\\'m not satisfied either. And that is why we\\'re taking new steps to help secure Baghdad and constantly adjusting our tactics across the country to meet the changing threat. But we cannot allow our dissatisfaction to turn into disillusionment about our purpose in this war. We must look at every success -- we must not look at every success of the enemy as a mistake on our part, cause for an investigation or a reason to call for our troops to come home. We must not fall prey to the sophisticated propaganda by the enemy, who is trying to undermine our confidence and make us believe that our presence in Iraq is the cause of all its problems. If I did not think our mission in Iraq was vital to America\\'s security, I\\'d bring our troops home tomorrow. I\\'ve met too many wives and husbands who\\'ve lost their partners in life; too many children who won\\'t ever see their mom and dad again. I owe it to them and to the families who still have loved ones in harm\\'s way to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. Our country\\'s faced adversity before during times of war. In past wars, we\\'ve lost young Americans who gave everything to protect our freedom and way of life. In this war, we\\'ve lost good men and women who\\'ve given their lives for a cause that is necessary and it is just. We mourn every loss. And we must gird ourselves for the sacrifices that are yet to come. America\\'s men and women in uniform are the finest in the world. I\\'m awed by their strength and their character. As General Casey reported yesterday in Iraq, the men and women of the armed forces have never lost a battle in over three years in the war. Every American can take pride in our troops and the vital work they are doing to protect us. Our troops are fighting a war that will set the course for this new century. The outcome will determine the destiny of millions across the world. Defeating the terrorists and extremists is the challenge of our time and the calling of this generation. I\\'m confident this generation will answer that call and defeat and ideology that is bent on destroying America and all that we stand for. And now I\\'ll be glad to answer some of your questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, the war in Iraq has lasted almost as long as World War II for the United States. And as you mentioned, October was the deadliest month for American forces this year -- in a year. Do you think we\\'re winning, and why? BUSH: First of all, this is a different kind of war than a war against the fascists in World War II. We were facing a nation state -- two nation states -- three nation states in World War II. We were able to find an enemy by locating its ships or aircraft or soldiers on the ground. This is a war against extremists and radicals who kill innocent people to achieve political objectives. It has a multiple of fronts. Afghanistan was a front in this war against the terrorists. Iraq is now the central front in the war against the terrorists. This war is more than just finding people and bringing them to justice. This war is an ideological conflict between a radical ideology that can\\'t stand freedom and moderate, reasonable people that hope to live in a peaceful society. And so it\\'s going to take a long time. I am confident we will succeed. I am confident we\\'ll succeed in Iraq. And the reason I\\'m confident we\\'ll succeed in Iraq is because the Iraqis want to succeed in Iraq. The ultimate victory in Iraq, which is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself, depends upon the Iraqi citizens and the Iraqi government doing the hard work necessary to protect their country. And our job is to help them achieve that objective. As a matter of fact, my view is: The only way we lose in Iraq is if we leave before the job is done. And I\\'m confident we can succeed in the broader war on terror, this ideological conflict. I\\'m confident because I believe the power of liberty will defeat the ideology of hate every time, if given a chance. I believe that the radicals represent the few in the Middle East. I believe the majority of people want to live in a peaceful world. That\\'s what I believe. And I know it\\'s incumbent upon our government, and others who enjoy the blessings of liberty, to help those moderates succeed. Because otherwise we\\'re looking at the potential of this kind of world, a world in which radical forms of Islam compete for power; a world in which moderate governments get toppled by people willing to murder the innocent; a world in which oil reserves are controlled by radicals in order to extract blackmail from the West; a world in which Iran has a nuclear weapon. And if that were to occur, people would look back at this day and age and say, What happened to those people in 2006? How come they couldn\\'t see the threat to a future generation of people? Defeat will only come is the United States becomes isolationist and refuses to, one, protect ourselves; and, two, help those who desire to become -- to live in a moderate, peaceful world. And it\\'s a hard struggle; no question about it. And it\\'s a different struggle. QUESTION: Are we winning? BUSH: Absolutely we\\'re winning. Al Qaida\\'s on the run. As a matter of fact, the mastermind, or the people who they think is the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks, is in our custody. We\\'ve now got a procedure for this person to go on trial, to be held for his account. Most of Al Qaida that planned the attacks on September the 11th have been brought to justice. Extremists have now played their hand. The world can clearly see their ambitions. You know, when a Palestinian state began to show progress, extremists attacked Israel, to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. They can\\'t stand democracies. Extremists and radicals want to undermine fragile democracy because it\\'s a defeat for their way of life, their ideology. People now understand the stakes. We\\'re winning and we will win, unless we leave before the job is done. And the crucial battle, right now, is Iraq. And as I said in my statement, I understand how tough it is, really tough. It\\'s tough for a reason, because people understand the stakes of success in Iraq. And my point to the American people is that we\\'re constantly adjusting our tactics to achieve victory. QUESTION: Are you considering sending more U.S. troops to Iraq? What would be the justification for it? And how reliable is this new timetable of 12 to 18 months? BUSH: The -- I will send more troops to Iraq if General Casey says, \"I need more troops in Iraq to achieve victory.\" And that\\'s the way I\\'ve been running this war. I have great faith in General Casey. I have great faith in Ambassador Khalilzad. I trust our commanders on the ground to give the best advice about how to achieve victory. I want to remind you, victory is a government that can sustain itself, govern -- it\\'s a country that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself and serves as an ally in the war on terror -- which stands in stark contrast to a government that would be chaotic, that would be a safe haven for the enemy to launch attacks on us. One way for the American people to understand what Iraq could look like is what Afghanistan looked like under the Taliban -- a place where there was no freedom, a place where women were taken to the public square and beaten if they did not adhere to the strict, intolerant guidelines of the Taliban, a place where thousands trained to attack America and our allies. Afghanistan doesn\\'t have nearly the resources that Iraq has. Imagine a safe haven for an enemy that ended up with the resources that it had. And so this is a war where I say to our generals, Do you have what it takes to win? Now, General Casey talked about part of our strategy. And part of the strategy is to give the Iraq government the tools necessary to protect itself, to defend itself. If you\\'re able to defend yourself, you\\'re more likely to be able to govern yourself, as well. But politics, the political way forward, and the military way forward, must go hand in hand. And what the general was saying yesterday is that there is a three-step process to enable the Iraqi forces to be able to help this government bring security. One was to train and equip. The goal is 325,000 troops -- 137,000 military and the balance police. Second was to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead. Six of 10 divisions now are in the lead in helping this government defend itself. The strategy has been to embed U.S. personnel, officers and noncomm. officers, into these forces to help them gain the confidence and the capacity to be effective when they\\'re in the lead. And the third step is for the Iraqi security forces to be able to operate independently. And this, perhaps, is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of having the Iraqis ready to go, because that means they have to be able to drive themselves, maintain their vehicles, provide logistics, have a combat service support. And that\\'s what General Casey was describing. The key is that our commanders feel that they have got enough flexibility to design the program to meet the conditions on the ground. You know, last spring, I thought for a period of time we\\'d be able to reduce our troop presence early next year. That\\'s what I felt. But because we didn\\'t have a fixed timetable and because General Casey and General Abizaid and the other generals there understand that the way we\\'re running this war is to give them flexibility, have the confidence necessary to come and make the recommendations here in Washington, D.C., they decided that that wasn\\'t going to happen. So what he was describing to you was the way forward, to make sure that the Iraqis are fully prepared to defend themselves. QUESTION:  Now, again, I understand how -- look, I read -- look at the newspapers around here. I can see why you think that, you know, I\\'m concealing something in my heart of hearts. The race is over as far as a lot of the punditry goes. You know, they\\'ve got it all figured out. And they just -- as I said, they\\'re dancing in the end zone. They just hadn\\'t scored the touchdown. You know, there\\'s a lot of time left. And these candidates are working hard out there. And my message to them is: Keep talking about the security of the United States and keeping taxes low, and you\\'ll come back here. Last question. QUESTION: Back in 2000, you campaigned around the country, saying you wanted to usher in the responsibility era, to end the days when people said: If it feels good, do it; and, if you\\'ve got a problem, blame somebody else. BUSH: Right. QUESTION: Over the last several months, we\\'ve seen many members of your own party in Congress embroiled in one scandal or another, and all too ready to blame somebody else, whether prosecutors or Democrats or even the media. So I\\'m wondering: Why do you think it is so many people in your own party have failed to live up the standards of the responsibility era? BUSH: If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account. It\\'s important for there to be trust in the halls of Congress and in the White House and throughout government. People have got to trust elected leaders in order for democracy to work to its fullest extent. And I fully expect, you know, people to be held to account if there\\'s wrong-doing; just like I expect corporate executives to be held to account for wrong-doing, just like I expect people throughout our society to be held to account for wrong-doing. People do have to take responsibility for the decisions they make in life. I take responsibility for the decisions I make. I also understand that those of us in positions of responsibility have the duty to bring, you know, honor to the offices we hold. People don\\'t have to agree with somebody\\'s opinion. There\\'s all kinds of opinions here. But in order to make this country work and to make democracy succeed, there\\'s got to be high standards and people must be held to account to achieve those standards. I thank you for your time. See you on the campaign trail. '"

       "\" Yes, He Said That, But What He Really Meant Was . . .       This fall and especially after the debates, The Times has analyzed the accuracy of statements made by the presidential candidates. Here are highlights of that coverage on some of the most important issues of the campaign.    IRAQ       More than a dozen times in the first debate on Oct. 1, President Bush accused Senator John Kerry of continually shifting positions on Iraq.     A review of Mr. Kerry's public statements found that his position had actually been quite consistent. But as the politics changed, Mr. Kerry repeatedly changed his emphasis. News accounts reflected what he was emphasizing at the time. And Mr. Kerry was often unclear in expressing his views.     On Oct. 9, 2002, Mr. Kerry was planning to run for president, but had not yet announced his candidacy. Before he voted to give Mr. Bush the authority to use force against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, he declared on the Senate floor: ''I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force, if we ever exhaust those other options, as the president has promised, but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances.''    That is essentially his position today. But look at what Mr. Kerry has said in the meantime:     In May 2003, two months after the United States invaded Iraq and routed Mr. Hussein's army, Mr. Kerry was the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, from the antiwar wing of the party, was not yet regarded as a serious threat. In a nine-candidate debate in Columbia, S.C., that month, Mr. Kerry declared: ''I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein. And when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.''     By October 2003, Dr. Dean had begun to emerge as a strong candidate and it had become clear that no unconventional weapons would be found in Iraq. Mr. Kerry asserted that month on the ABC News program ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'': ''The president and his advisers did not do almost anything correctly in the walk-up to the war. They rushed to war. They were intent on going to war. They did not give legitimacy to the inspections. We could have still been doing inspections even today.''   Five days later, Mr. Kerry voted against a Republican bill to provide $87 billion more to support American troops and to pay reconstruction costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Before that vote, he voted for a version of the measure Mr. Bush threatened to veto, a version that would have raised the $87 billion by repealing tax cuts for Americans with annual incomes of more than $200,000.     By March, Mr. Kerry had won the early contests, essentially clinching the nomination. On March 16, he explained his vote against the $87 billion for the troops by saying, in a comment Mr. Bush has repeatedly ridiculed, ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.''     On Aug. 9, following the Democratic convention, Mr. Kerry told reporters during a trip to the Grand Canyon that he ''would have voted for the authority'' for Mr. Bush to use troops in Iraq even if he had known that unconventional weapons would not be found and that no close connection existed between Iraq and Al Qaeda.     This was the first time Mr. Kerry had expressed that view, and reports emphasized it. Many accounts, especially those on television, did not include his further explanation that ''it's the right authority for a president to have'' and that, referring to subsequent events in Iraq, he ''would have done this very differently from the way President Bush has.''     Then last month on the radio program ''Imus in the Morning,'' the host, Don Imus, asked Mr. Kerry, ''Do you think there are any circumstances in which we should have gone to war in Iraq?'' Mr. Kerry replied: ''Not under the current circumstances, no. There are none that I see. I voted based on weapons of mass destruction. The president distorted that, and I've said that.''     That was another new point, and nearly all accounts emphasized it. Many did not include the rest of what Mr. Kerry said: ''But I think it was the right vote based on what Saddam Hussein had done, and I think it was the right thing to do to hold him accountable. I've said 100 times, there was a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. The president chose the wrong way.''    COALITION       Mr. Bush said the war in Iraq was being waged by a large coalition; Mr. Kerry said that the coalition was shrinking and that eight countries had left it.     As of this month, 30 foreign countries had joined the United States, but they contribute only about 24,000 troops, with Britain supplying 8,000 of them. The United States has about 138,000 troops in Iraq, and 90 percent of the non-Iraqi casualties have been American.     Eight allied countries have withdrawn troops from Iraq since February: the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Norway, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain and Thailand.    AL QAEDA       Mr. Bush's statement in the first debate that 75 percent of Osama bin Laden's ''people have been brought to justice'' is impossible to document. It appears to refer to terrorist leaders, a loosely defined category.   There is no reliable tally of how many Qaeda operatives ever existed, and the administration has not provided the number who have been captured or killed.    DOMESTIC SECURITY      Mr. Kerry complained in the first debate that money spent on the war could be better used for police, firefighters and other security measures at home.     He said the administration had put ''not one nickel'' into protection for vulnerable tunnels, bridges and subways.     That is an exaggeration.     Even Democratic critics demanding more spending on rail and transit security and lobbyists for transit systems say the federal government has spent millions of dollars, while local transit authorities have spent more than a billion dollars.    Mr. Bush's statement that the administration had ''tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year'' was an  approximation and embroidered somewhat the rate of growth. It depends in part on what programs are counted, and from what date.     Money for programs inherited by the new Department of Homeland Security from other agencies has more than doubled since 2001, to about $24 billion in the fiscal year 2004, according to a report in April by the Congressional Budget Office.    Related programs in other agencies have grown almost as fast, bringing total domestic security spending to about $41 billion, a doubling since 2001.    Democrats have argued for even faster growth in spending on some of these programs.    IRAQ AND U.N. SANCTIONS      In the second debate, on Oct. 8, President Bush and Senator Kerry drew contradictory conclusions from the 918-page report issued this month by Charles A. Duelfer, the top American arms inspector in Iraq, and their interpretations did not always accurately reflect the report's findings.     After Mr. Kerry said that the Duelfer report had demonstrated that United Nations sanctions against Iraq ''worked,'' Mr. Bush said the report's lesson instead was that it was ''naïve and dangerous'' to ''just let the inspectors do their job.''     In fact, that report did not draw a firm conclusion about whether the sanctions and inspections succeeded in disarming Iraq. It said that Saddam Hussein's ''primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have U.N. sanctions lifted.'' But it also said that between 2000 and 2001, Iraq ''managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support.''     Mr. Bush referred to findings pointing to how porous the sanctions were and showing Iraq's success between 1991 and 2003 at circumventing the restrictions, primarily through imports of conventional weapons.    But Mr. Kerry emphasized what he portrayed as the restrictions' bottom-line success, in prompting what Mr. Duelfer said was the fundamental decision that Iraq made after the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 to set aside its plans for illicit weapons, at least for the time being, to win an end to sanctions.    JOBS      Mr. Kerry said in the second debate that Mr. Bush's was the first presidency in 72 years in which the number of jobs had fallen and that the nation had lost 1.6 million jobs since 2000. Mr. Bush said 1.9 million new jobs had been created in the last 13 months.     Mr. Kerry's figure for job losses counted only private-sector jobs. More than 1 million government jobs have been created. The total jobs lost has been about 585,000 through last month.     Mr. Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover to have had the number of jobs fall during his term. The nearly 2 million new jobs created in a little more than a year still leaves the administration in the hole.    TAXES AND THE BUDGET      Mr. Bush said in the third debate that most of the tax reduction in his presidency had gone ''to low- and middle-income Americans.''    In fact, Internal Revenue Service figures compiled by the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute show that half of all the tax cuts in effect this year go to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above about $112,000.    One-quarter of the cuts go to the richest 1 percent, those with incomes above about $357,000.    Mr. Bush also said the cuts were needed ''to get us out of the recession.'' But he proposed the cuts in his last presidential campaign, in 2000, before anyone knew that a recession was at hand, and he justified them by saying the surplus should be returned to the taxpayers.     The president said, as he often has elsewhere, that Mr. Kerry had voted for tax increases 98 times. That is probably true. But many, if not most, of those were multiple votes on the same bills or on nonbinding resolutions and motions. Mr. Kerry voted against the tax increase pushed by the president's father in 1990 to reduce the budget deficit. He voted for one large tax increase -- the Clinton bill of 1993, which imposed most of the increases on upper-income payers. Mr. Kerry said Mr. Bush had proposed $3 trillion in new spending, and Mr. Bush said Mr. Kerry had proposed $2 trillion. Neither claim can be proved, because the details of their proposals are so vague.    Mr. Kerry was correct when he said the budget had a projected $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office and now has large deficits for the foreseeable future.     But Mr. Kerry was not accurate when he said he had shown ''exactly how'' he intended to pay for all his spending proposals. In fact, he lists as additional revenues such vague promises as closing corporate loopholes and making the government more efficient.     The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that seeks deficit reduction, projects that Mr. Bush would cut taxes by $1.2 trillion in the coming decade, while Mr. Kerry would reduce revenues by $498 billion. New spending proposed by Senator Kerry would total $771 billion in the next decade, compared with $82 billion proposed by Mr. Bush.    BETTER OFF, WORSE OFF      Much of the third debate turned on the question of whether Americans had more money in their pockets as a result of President Bush's policies.     Mr. Kerry offered an array of statistics that in his view showed that people were worse off than they were at the beginning of the Bush presidency.     Mr. Bush accused his challenger of ''a litany of misstatements'' and held that voters were in better financial shape because of his tax cuts. But, as with the Kerry data, the accuracy of the president's statements is not obvious.     The truth seems to be that, after adjustments for inflation, Americans on average may have more money at their disposal. But more people are worse off than are better off.     The trick is in the word ''average.'' Average income -- all the income in the country divided by the total number of people -- has gone up because of the large increase in after-tax income enjoyed by the very wealthy.     But median income -- the point at which half the people have more and half less -- has dropped.    SOCIAL SECURITY, THE DRAFT      For weeks, the president attacked Mr. Kerry in ways that the Kerry campaign and outside commentators called distortions. After their last debate, Mr. Kerry began criticizing President Bush on Social Security and the draft in a manner that reached far beyond Mr. Bush's positions.     On Social Security, Mr. Kerry maintained that Mr. Bush planned a ''January surprise'' that could cost retirees up to 45 percent of their monthly checks. On the draft, Mr. Kerry said that involuntary extensions and National Guard call-ups amounted to a backdoor draft. He also told The Des Moines Register that there was ''the great potential of the draft'' if Mr. Bush won a second term.     Mr. Kerry's implication that people now retired stood to have their benefits cut was not fair. Mr. Bush has promised not to cut the Social Security benefits of current retirees or those nearing retirement age, and no plan under consideration would do that.     On the draft, Mr. Bush said flatly in the second debate that he had no plans to reinstate military conscription. There is hardly any political support for a draft, and the Pentagon is very much opposed to one.\""

       "[\"Long ago, political parties had a heavy hand in picking their presidential nominees. Now, in most big states except New York, voters do the picking in primaries or political caucuses. Through an arcane system that requires even candidates who have qualified nationally for federal election funds to amass signatures and jump through qualifying hoops, New York's political parties have, by mutual legislative agreement, limited the candidates on their ballots to two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, and as few as one Republican in some areas, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.    The Democrats have made it easier for candidates' names to appear on their ballot, requiring  a campaign to get only 5,000 valid signatures statewide, as opposed to about 20,000 for the Republicans.  But even the lesser requirement is onerous, undemocratic and outdated. New York's entire  ballot-qualification exercise ranks as a political throwback to the old party-boss days before voters could see and assess the various candidates on television. For that reason, states like California automatically add the names of those considered ''viable'' by the media. Some states include any candidate qualified for federal funds or ask for a modest filing fee. Unlike New York, these states want to offer voters a basic political right: the ability to choose among all available candidates for a given office.  \",\n",
       " \" THE REPUBLICANS    ONLINE FUND-RAISER: The McCain campaign has scheduled its first live online fund-raiser on Feb. 10, an event that political professionals said was probably a first for any candidate. Senator John McCain will be at a fund-raiser in Washington, and for $100, anyone would be able to participate over the Internet, watching and hearing him on a computer. He will take questions from people online. Campaign aides said that more than 60,000 people had volunteered through the McCain Web site and that the campaign had raised more than $1.5 million through the site.   Richard Perez-Pena    PAPER WAR: The Manchester Union Leader, New Hampshire's largest newspaper, was a battleground for Steve Forbes yesterday. On the front page was yet another editorial supporting him. Inside was a half-page advertisement from the Bush campaign, criticizing Mr. Forbes for his attacks on Gov. George W. Bush, and a full-page advertisement from the Catholic Alliance, an anti-abortion group, thanking Mr. Forbes for having ''spoken out on Catholic issues.'' William Dal Col, campaign manager for Mr. Forbes, said that the Bush advertisement mimicked ones by the Republican Leadership Council, which was proof, he contended, that the independent political group was improperly coordinating with the Bush campaign.

       " \" THE DEMOCRATS    ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP TO BACK GORE: Since Bill Bradley said last month that Vice President Al Gore was being dishonest in denying his past votes against abortion, the Gore campaign has worked feverishly to secure an endorsement from abortion-rights proponents, and that endorsement appears to be at hand. The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is planning to bestow its endorsement on Mr. Gore on Tuesday. Its past rating of Mr. Gore, for voting in favor of abortion rights only 23 percent of the time during his House tenure from 1976 to 1982, has been used against him, and the group wants to repay the Clinton administration for its strong support of abortion rights.   Katharine Q. Seelye    NO TEXAS OFFICE FOR BRADLEY: Vice President Al Gore's campaign opened a Texans for Gore office in Austin on Saturday in anticipation of the state's March 14 primary. But former Senator Bill Bradley's local forces say they have no plans to open a state headquarters. ''We don't spend money on space,'' said Peck Young, political director for Mr. Bradley's Texas campaign. ''We spend money on volunteers and materials. We really don't need a place for people to hang out and drink Cokes.'' Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner and longtime friend of President Clinton, will lead the vice president's Texas campaign.

       " \"Now that the presidential race is reaching full throttle, each new election barrels down on the candidates before they can even catch their breath from the one just past. The three states voting Tuesday -- Washington, Virginia and North Dakota -- pose the toughest challenges for former Senator Bill Bradley and Senator John McCain. For the first time since New Hampshire, they will now be scrambling with each other for crossover votes from all parties. But since Mr. Bradley has not won a primary yet, he is fighting hardest to hang on. Washington is the place he has chosen for a showdown with Vice President Al Gore. With the state's prosperous high-tech-oriented voters likely to be receptive to his appeal, Mr. Bradley needs to do well, or risk falling back even further.    Washington is known as a place for free-thinking independents with a soft spot for thoughtful interlopers. To appeal to them, Mr. Bradley is taking a major risk of campaigning there for five days, a step that will invite political pundits and professionals to question the viability of his candidacy if he fails to produce a big turnout. For the last six weeks, Mr. Bradley has had the misfortune of seeing Senator McCain usurp what he hoped would be his role as outsider and reformer. Now in Washington, his main problem is that Mr. McCain could pull away the independents and crossover Democrats that Mr. Bradley needs to offset Mr. Gore's strength among core Democrats. On the Democratic side, the Washington vote is strictly a ''beauty contest,'' with actual delegates to be selected later. But it is still of vital importance to the former senator, and in response, Vice President Gore has stepped up his own campaigning in the Northwest.  \",\n",

       " \" THE NORTH    A CHALLENGER FOR KENNEDY -- Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusettshas accumulated a hefty $3.6 million in his re-election fund. And that money, along with the Kennedy name and 38 years of incumbency, were enough yesterday to scare off one potential Republican foe, District Attorney Michael Sullivan of Plymouth County. But no sooner had Mr. Sullivan said that he would not run than another Republican, Jack E. Robinson 3rd, announced that he would take on the senator. In fact, Mr. Robinson, a 39-year-old cell phone entrepreneur, said he planned to use up to $1 million of his own money to run. ''It's absolutely a long shot,'' he conceded. ''We're the underdog. But at the end of the day, ideas are going to win out.'' Mr. Robinson, a Boston-born African-American whose father once headed the city's N.A.A.C.P. chapter, is seeking to be the third popularly elected African-American senator. He has never held political office. But state Republican leaders see him as the party's last best hope as a Kennedy challenger, in part because the state has a strong civil rights record but also because they believe his fiscally conservative, socially moderate approach to politics, including support for abortion rights, will appeal to a broad spectrum of Massachusetts voters. ''He's going to be reaching out not only to Republicans, but to Democrats and independents as well,'' said John Brockelman, executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ''He's going to run under the Republican reform banner.'' If elected, Mr. Robinson would be the second black Republican to represent Massachusetts in the Senate; Edward W. Brooke served two terms, 1967 to 1979.   \",\n",

From Jan. 1 to March 31, the committee reported, more than $26 million flowed into the party's coffers and, it said, $22 million was still on hand as of April 1. The Republican National Committee reported, by contrast, that it had raised $24 million over the same span and had $18 million on deposit as of April 1. Both parties are fattening their soft-money accounts with big, loosely regulated contributions from corporations, unions, interest groups and wealthy individuals, the aim being to pay for campaigns on behalf of their presumed nominees in the months preceding the summer conventions. ''These are wonderful figures,'' said Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic party. Jim Nicholson, the Republican chairman, was equally ebullient, despite the second-place finish. ''There's never been such excitement in the Republican ranks,'' Mr. Nicholson said.     John M. Broder \",\n",

But he said on Wednesday in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, as he had said before, that while he had no fire in the belly to run for office he would consider any nonpolitical role offered to him by a president or president-elect -- thereby keeping alive the possibility that he might end up in the cabinet should Gov. George W. Bush win in November. The general, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a registered Republican, acknowledged his consistently high ranking in national polls, but he said that ranking had never been tested in the political arena and therefore meant nothing. ''That number you always see is a popularity number,'' he said. ''It's not a political number.'' Still, the general has not been shy about weighing in on some political issues.

       " \" THE REPUBLICANS    KEYES FIRM ON ABORTION  The abortion issue continues to present potential problems for the Republican Party, with Alan Keyes, a presidential candidate, considering leaving the party if it weakens its stance against abortion. Connie Hair, Mr. Keyes's press secretary, says he will possibly join the Constitution Party and seek its nomination if the Republicans do not retain a strong anti-abortion position in their platform or if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, picks a running mate who is not anti-abortion. The Constitution Party is strongly anti-abortion. Ms. Hair made her comments to USA Today over the weekend, then elaborated on them yesterday. Mr. Keyes has not been heard from much lately. But Ms. Hair emphasized that while Mr. Keyes reserved the right to abandon the Republican Party over the abortion issue, he was for the moment still a candidate for the Republican nomination, had delegates pledged to him and intended to attend the party convention in Philadelphia. The Constitution Party already has a presidential candidate, Howard Phillips, who said yesterday, ''I am prepared to discuss anything with Alan Keyes, including the possibility of his becoming our candidate for president or vice president, but my present intention is to continue as the presidential nominee.''

       " \" THE HOUSE    MISSOURI DEMOCRAT QUITS RACE -- Battling breast cancer, Representative Pat Danner, Democrat of Missouri, has ended her bid for re-election to a fifth term. Her surprise departure, announced late Monday, makes her the eighth House Democrat to retire this year, compared with 24 Republicans who are leaving, and hangs still another question mark over the struggle for control of the House this year. Ms. Danner's son Steve, a former state representative, immediately said he would run in her place in the August primary. Ms. Danner, a 66-year-old moderate-to-conservative, disclosed in January that she was being treated for breast cancer but said that her prognosis was excellent. She won 71 percent of the vote in her re-election in 1998 and seemed headed for an easy victory this year in her Congressional district, the Sixth, which  Bill Clinton carried in 1992 and 1996. But Republican leaders said they believed that her withdrawal gave them a good shot at picking up a seat. ''This is a crushing setback for Democrats,'' Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. His Democratic counterpart, Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, said that ''the Sixth District is Democratic territory.''   Dirk Johnson \",\n",
       " \" THE DEMOCRATS    BARRY LOOMS AGAIN -- Marion S. Barry Jr., once the very popular, very visible and very controversial mayor of Washington, is telling friends he may run again, this time for a seat on the City Council. Though out of office for 14 months, Mr. Barry still has a large political following in the city. But should he run, he faces a couple of major obstacles: the person who holds the council seat Mr. Barry is eyeing has no intention of going quietly, and the present mayor, Anthony A. Williams, says he will support Mr. Barry in just about anything except a return to office. Mr. Barry served on the City Council before being elected mayor, an incumbency notable, among other things, for his imprisonment on a drug conviction. On his release, he was elected once more to the City Council and capped his comeback by being elected mayor again. Mr. Williams, who was elected mayor by campaigning largely against mismanagement and overspending in the Barry era, said recently that he would support Mr. Barry ''in whatever capacity other than serving on the City Council.'' Harold Brazil, the council incumbent Mr. Barry may challenge, announced last week that he was running for re-election so that he could help the city continue its recovery.   Irvin Molotsky     THE REPUBLICANS    BUSH ON CHARACTER -- Taking his campaign to a major swing state, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared yesterday in Detroit that education was ''the new civil right.'' With Michigan's popular Republican governor, John Engler, at his side, Mr. Bush spent more than an hour discussing the importance of equal access to education with students, teachers, parents and volunteers at the Cornerstone Schools, a private religion-oriented group of middle and elementary schools. ''We can't have any gaps of hope in the country,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The American dream is available for everyone, which means every child must be educated.''\",\n",
       " \" THE REPUBLICANS    A PLEDGE FOR VETERANS -- Gov. George W. Bush used a D-Day celebration yesterday to make a promise to the nation's veterans, especially those of World War II. If he is elected president, he said, he will revamp the ''bureaucratic'' Department of Veterans Affairs and push through improvements in Social Security to preserve benefits for ''our greatest generation.'' ''A grateful nation keeps faith with the old soldier,'' Mr. Bush said in Augusta, Ga., on the 56th anniversary of the Normandy landing. ''Too often in Washington those who served in the military are remembered only on Veterans Day.'' He  said that this week, he would recommend changes in how Veterans Affairs operates. He also called Social Security a solemn commitment to the World War II generation and accused Vice President Al Gore of using ''scare tactics'' in criticizing his plans. With the retirement of the baby boom generation threatening the solvency of Social Security, Mr. Bush has called for part of the payroll tax of younger workers to be diverted to individual accounts that could be invested in the market. Yesterday in Washington, opponents of such a plan released a study saying that creating such accounts would require deep cuts in the guaranteed Social Security benefit.   Alison Mitchell \",\n",
       " \" THE DEMOCRATS    GORE PLANS 'PROSPERITY TOUR'  Vice President Al Gore plans a ''progress and prosperity tour'' next week in which he will propose protecting Medicare by taking it off-budget, meaning he would remove it from annual budget fights. ''It's the next logical step to ensuring our long-term security,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''What Al Gore is going to be doing next week is talking about the choices that we face in terms of continuing economic strength.'' In contrast to President Clinton's ''poverty tour'' last year, the vice president's tour is intended to highlight the economic successes of the last eight years -- and by extension associate Mr. Gore with that success. The vice president said tonight at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, ''progress and prosperity ought to be expected in this country.'' Mr. Gore's fly-around will include several of the crucial battleground states across the Rust Belt, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Advisers said the tour was part of a long-planned strategy to emphasize the positive and optimistic aspects of Mr. Gore's candidacy. It is to coincide with the release of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this week to continue to redefine Mr. Gore's image.    Katharine Q. Seelye \",\n",
       " \" THE DEMOCRATS  GORE CONSIDERS HIS LEGACY  Vice President Al Gore has clearly given extensive thought to his legacy. Emphasis on extensive. Here was his answer Thursday at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles when a guest asked him how history would view him after two terms as president: ''I would hope that at the end of my tenure it would be said that during those years the American people reached their highest potential and had obstacles and impediments removed from their way, that the progress and prosperity of our nation continued and accelerated, that we gave every child health care and moved quickly toward universal health care for all, that we revolutionized the educational system and brought the productivity revolution of the private sector into the schools and respected teachers and made our schools the very best in the world. I would want it said that we were a more harmonious nation where race and ethnicity were understood and recognized but didn't make a difference because we respected one another's differences and embraced what we had in common. I would want it said that violence declined sharply. I would want it said that the environment became a central principle of what we did and how we did it and that we led the world toward a successful confrontation with the problem of global warming. I would want it said that we reformed our politics and campaign financing and that we made democracy more real in the lives of our people, and finally, I would want it said that at the end of those years we as Americans had a stronger belief in our own ability to govern ourselves and to make our dreams real.''

       " \" THE REPUBLICANS    STARS, BARS AND BRUISES -- Gov. George W. Bush was criticized during the primary campaign for refusing to take sides in the emotional debate over the Confederate flag flying atop South Carolina's Capitol. But over the weekend in Texas, the governor played a role in the replacement of two State Supreme Court plaques featuring Confederate flags with new plaques devoid of any Confederate symbols. The replacement was the work of the state's General Services Commission, which acted in consultation with the governor's office and the Supreme Court. Bush aides say it was ''strictly a Texas issue,'' totally unrelated to either the presidential campaign or the South Carolina dispute. The Texas plaques had generated debate in recent months after the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People asked that they be taken down. N.A.A.C.P. officials praised Mr. Bush for ''putting principle above politics,'' but groups opposed to replacing the plaques, which were removed on Friday night, have vowed daily demonstrations and a court suit. ''This is a sad day when officials of the state come in the dead of night and rip our heritage off the walls of a public building,'' said Kirk Lyons, director of the North Carolina-based Southern Legal Resource Center.

       " \" THE REPUBLICANS    RATING RUNNING MATES -- The speculation started two weeks ago with a report in Time that Gov. George W. Bush was giving serious consideration to former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri as his running mate. Mr. Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 and is now leading the special investigation into the Branch Davidian incident in Texas, declined to comment. So did Mr. Bush, except to insist that despite all the rumors in the air, only his wife and his vice-presidential search adviser knew what he was thinking. Whereupon the rumors picked up speed. By the end of last week, Mr. Danforth ranked 15th on the ''Veepstakes Scoreboard,'' the tally the Hotline political tip sheet keeps of how often possible vice-presidential choices merit a major media mention. Mr. Danforth had 10 mentions, compared with 49 for Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, No. 1 on the 53-name list. On Monday, Mr. Danforth made a move, telling The St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he had told Mr. Bush that the idea was ''very tempting,'' but that the six years since he had left Washington and politics had been the best of his life. So wherever Mr. Danforth stood on the rumor list, was he ever really on the Bush list? No comment from Mr. Bush.   \",\n",

       " \" THE POLLS    BUSH LEAD GETS SMALLER -- Three new polls taken over the weekend indicate that Gov. George W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore is narrowing. A CBS News survey shows Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 43 percent to 41 percent, down from his 47-to-39 edge in May. A Zogby poll has Mr. Bush holding a 45-to-41 lead, compared with a 47-to-39 edge a month ago. And a USA Today/ CNN Gallup poll has Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 45 to 43, compared with 50 to 41 a week ago. The CBS poll covered 596 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the Bush lead was statistically insignificant. Significantly, however, Mr. Bush's potential voters were more likely than his rival's to say they supported him enthusiastically. And when people who leaned to Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore were added to those firmly committed, Mr. Bush led 46 to 43. When Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party were added to the poll, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Gore 42 to 37, and Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan got 4 percent each. In the Zogby poll, which surveyed 890 likely voters and had a three percentage point sampling error, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 43 to 37 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader getting 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. In the USA/CNN poll, which surveyed 1,063 registered voters over the weekend and has a four percentage point error margin, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 45 to 43 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader picking up 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. The USA/CNN poll showed Mr. Gore gained support from women and independents in the past week, apparently helped by the endorsement of former Senator Bill Bradley.   Adam Clymer \",\n",

The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat who had balked, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, which Israelis and Palestinians both claim as their sacred capital.   A1    Mr. Barak flew home to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters and his country sharply divided over the startling new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control.

A1    Mr. Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative voting records during 10 years as a Republican congressman from Wyoming.   A19    The Gore camp expressed relief at Mr. Cheney's selection and, citing his Congressional record, quickly sought to portray him as far outside the mainstream.   A20    While Mr. Cheney handled the screening of the other prospects for the ticket, Mr. Bush himself conducted the interview of Mr. Cheney about his finances and personal life.   A18    Mr. Cheney's doctors said he takes many medications for heart disease and other conditions but that he is in excellent health.   A19    Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne V.

A20    The State of Black America  The National Urban League said in its annual overview on the state of black America that home ownership among blacks was at a record high and unemployment was reaching a record low. But the report also noted that blacks represented a disproportionately high number of adults and juveniles in prison and of those dying of cancer, AIDS and other diseases. It also said that black men trailed black women in educational success and that the gap was widening.

       " \" THE POLLS    TUNING OUT THE NEWS  Journalists' coverage of the characters of the presidential contenders has had little effect on voters' perception of the characters of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, according to a study released yesterday. The study's authors at the Project for Excellence in Journalism, in Washington, said that journalists' statements about a candidate's character -- that Mr. Bush was inexperienced, for example, or that Mr. Gore was prone to stretch the truth -- were usually accompanied with supporting evidence but that denials of such assertions were given short shrift. The study examined a sampling of five months of election coverage in 17 news outlets, including network news broadcasts, Sunday morning talk shows, cable news talk shows, national and regional newspapers and online publications. The study compared the themes the journalists emphasized with voters' perceptions of the candidates, as measured in a separate survey of 1,204 potential voters conducted by the Pew Research Center. The comparison indicated that voters gave issues like Mr. Bush's family connections or Mr. Gore's fund-raising tactics substantially different weight than journalists did. The journalists' ''lens on what's being said by one candidate or others doesn't affect the public,'' said Amy Mitchell, one of the study's authors. But, the study noted, journalists offered no evidence for their statements or cited the work of other journalists about one-quarter of the time that they made assertions about the candidates' characters. The researchers found that coverage of Mr. Bush tended to rely on his conduct of this campaign for evidence about his character, while coverage of Mr. Gore tended to rely on his record in Congress, the Senate and the Clinton administration.

KERRYSPEAK PRIZE: ''I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of a troubled world.''    MOST PROBLEMATIC WORD: Mistake. Asked to name three mistakes he had made, President Bush declined to specify a single one. Senator John Kerry, just seconds after declaring that ''the president made a mistake in invading Iraq,'' was reminded of his famous line about Vietnam and asked if Americans in Iraq ''are now dying for a mistake.'' Without hesitation, he replied, ''No.''    MOST AWKWARD SEGUE: Mr. Bush's response to Mr. Kerry's attack on Republicans for blocking attempts to raise the minimum wage. After timidly uttering one sentence about supporting one Republican proposal to raise the wage, Mr. Bush said: ''But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to, and that's to make sure the education system works. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act, when you think about it.''    Actually, when you think about it, that worker is probably a little old to benefit from that law unless he's violating child labor laws.    TOO MUCH INFORMATION PRIZE: Mr. Kerry and his campaign, for indignantly disputing Mr. Bush's assertion that he had passed only five bills in his Senate career. ''Once again, the president is misleading America,'' he said. ''I have passed 56 individual bills that I have personally written.''     His press office followed up with a list of the 56 legislative achievements, none of which brought to mind Daniel Webster. Among the highlights:     A ''joint resolution designating Oct. 22 through 28, 1989, as 'World Population Awareness Week'''; a ''resolution amending the Standing Rules of the Senate to change the name of the Committee on Small Business to the 'Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship'; a ''bill to re-designate the federal building located at 380 Trapelo Road in Waltham, Mass., as the 'Frederick C. Murphy Federal Center,''' and, lest we forget, ''a resolution to recognize the accomplishments of Lewis A. Shattuck.''    DEBATE ISSUE LEAST LIKELY TO DECIDE THE ELECTION EVEN IF ANYONE UNDERSTOOD IT: Sub-chapter S corporations.    ROSE-COLORED GLASSES AWARD : Mr. Kerry's vision that the ''tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.'' His math may make sense, but there just might be members of Congress with their own calculations about that money: ''Well, we could either salt it away for a Social Security recipient in 2075 or spend it on a highway in my district in 2006. Hmm. Let me think. Which of those years am I up for re-election?''    MOST EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC LINE: Mr. Kerry's quick response after Mr. Bush justified the Iraq war by saying, ''The enemy attacked us.'' Mr. Kerry called that ''extraordinarily revealing'' and said, ''Saddam Hussein didn't attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us.'' Mr. Bush just drew more attention to it by peevishly responding, ''Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that.''    LEAST EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC LINE: Mr. Kerry's assertion that pre-emptive American military action must pass ''the global test.'' A gift that Mr. Bush promptly seized on and never let go.    MOST EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LINE: Vice President Dick Cheney, who discussed Mr. Kerry's and Mr. Edwards's vote against funds for the Iraq war during the primaries by saying, ''Now, if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaeda?'' The image of Dean the Intimidator worked so well that Mr. Bush borrowed it in the next debate.    LEAST EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LINE: Mr. Bush's denial that he had ever said he was not concerned about catching Osama bin Laden. It guaranteed that his original statement would be replayed again and again, leaving viewers to wonder which was stranger: claiming not to care about catching bin Laden, or claiming not to have said it in the first place.    ODDEST VERBAL TIC: Both candidates' penchant for addressing their answers to the moderator. Why, when there were tens of millions of voters watching, did they keep chatting up ''Jim'' and ''Bob''?    MOST SURPRISING LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP: Mr. Bush's analysis of the Dred Scott decision. ''Judges years ago said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights,'' he explained. ''That's a personal opinion; that's not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that. It doesn't speak to the equality of America.''    SMARTEST DEMOCRATIC CONCESSION: Agreeing to the green-yellow-red-light system. The Bush negotiators, aware of Mr. Kerry's experience in debating, had fought to cramp his style with a tight format. But the strict limits proved awkward for Mr. Bush, who sometimes had trouble filling his time, while the lights were a godsend for Mr. Kerry. They forced him to do what his advisers had been fruitlessly wishing he would do on the campaign trail: come to the point and stop talking.    SMARTEST REPUBLICAN CONCESSION: Agreeing to three debates. The decision seemed questionable at first, since incumbents typically shy from debates and Mr. Bush could have gotten away with doing just two or maybe even one. His advisers explained the strategy by predicting that the more voters saw of Mr. Kerry, the less they would like him. It didn't quite turn out that way. Mr. Kerry turned in consistent performances and was, if anything, more likable in the last debate. But Mr. Bush benefited nonetheless, because he started off so badly and then had two chances to redeem himself.    MOST RELIEVED AMERICAN NOW THAT THE DEBATES ARE OVER: Mary Cheney.  \",\n",

       " \" Secret Weapon For Bush?      To Bush-bashers, it may be the most infuriating revelation yet from the military records of the two presidential candidates: the young George W. Bush probably had a higher I.Q. than did the young John Kerry.     That, at least, is the conclusion of Steve Sailer, a conservative columnist at the Web magazine Vdare.com and a veteran student of presidential I.Q.'s. During the last presidential campaign Mr. Sailer estimated from Mr. Bush's SAT score  that his I.Q. was in the mid-120's, about 10 points lower than Al Gore's.     Mr. Kerry's SAT score is not known, but now Mr. Sailer has done a comparison of the intelligence tests in the candidates' military records. They are not formal I.Q. tests, but Mr. Sailer says they are similar enough to make reasonable extrapolations.    Mr. Bush's score on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test at age 22 again suggests that his I.Q was the mid-120's, putting Mr. Bush in about the 95th percentile of the population, according to Mr. Sailer. Mr. Kerry's I.Q. was about 120, in the 91st percentile, according to Mr. Sailer's extrapolation of his score at age 22 on the Navy Officer Qualification Test.    Linda Gottfredson, an I.Q. expert at the University of Delaware, called it a creditable analysis said she was not surprised at the results or that so many people had assumed that Mr. Kerry was smarter. ''People will often be misled into thinking someone is brighter if he says something complicated they can't understand,'' Professor Gottfredson said.    Many Americans still believe a report that began circulating on the Internet three years ago, and was quoted in ''Doonesbury,'' that Mr. Bush's I.Q. was 91, the lowest of any modern American president. But that report from the non-existent Lovenstein Institute turned out to be a hoax.     You might expect Kerry campaign officials, who have worried that their candidate's intellectual image turns off voters, to quickly rush out a commercial trumpeting these new results, but for some reason they seem to be resisting the temptation.    Upon hearing of their candidate's score, Michael Meehan, a spokesman for the senator, said merely: ''The true test is not where you start out in life, but what you do with those God-given talents. John Kerry's 40 years of public service puts him in the top percentile on that measure.''    A Nader Nibble From the Right      The commercial made its national debut on Thursday on the Fox News Channel, aimed directly at Mr. Bush's Republican base. It starts with a middle-aged man disgustedly dropping his Wall Street Journal on the kitchen table. ''What kind of conservative runs half-trillion-a-year deficits? Gets us into an unwinnable war?'' he asks his wife, but adds helplessly, ''I can't vote for Kerry.''    ''Then don't,'' she says, cheerily suggesting an alternative who is not quite yet a household name: Michael Badnarik, a computer consultant from Austin, Tex.    Mr. Badnarik is the presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party, which says he could ''Naderize'' Mr. Bush. A recent Zogby/Reuters national poll showed him tied with Ralph Nader at one percentage point each -- not much, but possibly critical. Unlike Mr. Nader, Mr. Badnarik is on the ballot of every battleground state except New Hampshire.    ''If we have a rerun of Florida 2000 in Pennsylvania, Michael Badnarik could be the kingmaker by drawing independent and Republican votes from Bush,'' said Larry Jacobs, director of the 2004 Election Project at the Humphrey Institute of the University of Minnesota, which has been tracking third-party candidates.    Mr. Badnarik, reached by telephone on Thursday while campaigning in Michigan, said that polls commissioned by his campaign showed him at 2 percent in Wisconsin, 3 percent in Nevada and 5 percent in New Mexico.     He dispatched quickly with most of the major campaign issues. Foreign policy? ''I would be bringing our troops home from Iraq and 135 other countries.'' Taxes? ''I would eliminate the I.R.S. completely.'' Health care? ''Of all the things I want the government out of, health care is probably the first thing.''    The only issue he ducked was abortion. Although the Libertarian platform supports abortion rights, he said, the party is almost evenly divided on the question. ''It's not a religious issue,'' Mr. Badnarik explained. ''It's a property-rights issue: at what point does the baby take ownership of its own body? I do not have a clear-cut answer.''    Vote Your Way To a Fat Wallet      The most widely advertised lie this election is probably the one coming from the earnest campaigns imploring you to turn out on Election Day. Your vote matters, they keep saying, but it doesn't. No matter what state you live in, you have a much better chance of being struck by lightning on the way to the polls than of casting a decisive ballot in the presidential election.    Then why will Americans spend millions of valuable hours casting individually meaningless votes? Are these commercials deluding them into violating the basic economic principle of self-interest?    Not at all, says Robert Frank, a Cornell economist who analyzes such supposedly irrational behavior in his book, ''What Price the Moral High Ground?'' Most people vote, Professor Frank says, not because they fail to grasp the logic of self-interest, but rather because they consider it their civic duty to do so, and that is a profitable instinct.    It may seem odd that the people most likely to vote are the most affluent and most educated, presumably the ones whose time is most valuable and who understand most clearly how little their vote means. But their enthusiasm for voting is one reason they are affluent, Professor Frank says. People who like to engage in civic-minded activities tend to do better in business because they are perceived as trustworthy, he says.    ''We're pretty good judges of character,'' Professor Frank said, ''and none of us would ever want to hire the homo-economicus stereotype that populates most economic models.'' So even if your vote doesn't matter in the election, it could pay off in other ways.  \",\n",

       " \" Yes, He Said That, But What He Really Meant Was . . .       This fall and especially after the debates, The Times has analyzed the accuracy of statements made by the presidential candidates. Here are highlights of that coverage on some of the most important issues of the campaign.    IRAQ       More than a dozen times in the first debate on Oct. 1, President Bush accused Senator John Kerry of continually shifting positions on Iraq.     A review of Mr. Kerry's public statements found that his position had actually been quite consistent. But as the politics changed, Mr. Kerry repeatedly changed his emphasis. News accounts reflected what he was emphasizing at the time. And Mr. Kerry was often unclear in expressing his views.     On Oct. 9, 2002, Mr. Kerry was planning to run for president, but had not yet announced his candidacy. Before he voted to give Mr. Bush the authority to use force against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, he declared on the Senate floor: ''I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force, if we ever exhaust those other options, as the president has promised, but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances.''    That is essentially his position today. But look at what Mr. Kerry has said in the meantime:     In May 2003, two months after the United States invaded Iraq and routed Mr. Hussein's army, Mr. Kerry was the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, from the antiwar wing of the party, was not yet regarded as a serious threat. In a nine-candidate debate in Columbia, S.C., that month, Mr. Kerry declared: ''I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein. And when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.''     By October 2003, Dr. Dean had begun to emerge as a strong candidate and it had become clear that no unconventional weapons would be found in Iraq. Mr. Kerry asserted that month on the ABC News program ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'': ''The president and his advisers did not do almost anything correctly in the walk-up to the war. They rushed to war. They were intent on going to war. They did not give legitimacy to the inspections. We could have still been doing inspections even today.''   Five days later, Mr. Kerry voted against a Republican bill to provide $87 billion more to support American troops and to pay reconstruction costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Before that vote, he voted for a version of the measure Mr. Bush threatened to veto, a version that would have raised the $87 billion by repealing tax cuts for Americans with annual incomes of more than $200,000.     By March, Mr. Kerry had won the early contests, essentially clinching the nomination. On March 16, he explained his vote against the $87 billion for the troops by saying, in a comment Mr. Bush has repeatedly ridiculed, ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.''     On Aug. 9, following the Democratic convention, Mr. Kerry told reporters during a trip to the Grand Canyon that he ''would have voted for the authority'' for Mr. Bush to use troops in Iraq even if he had known that unconventional weapons would not be found and that no close connection existed between Iraq and Al Qaeda.     This was the first time Mr. Kerry had expressed that view, and reports emphasized it. Many accounts, especially those on television, did not include his further explanation that ''it's the right authority for a president to have'' and that, referring to subsequent events in Iraq, he ''would have done this very differently from the way President Bush has.''     Then last month on the radio program ''Imus in the Morning,'' the host, Don Imus, asked Mr. Kerry, ''Do you think there are any circumstances in which we should have gone to war in Iraq?'' Mr. Kerry replied: ''Not under the current circumstances, no. There are none that I see. I voted based on weapons of mass destruction. The president distorted that, and I've said that.''     That was another new point, and nearly all accounts emphasized it. Many did not include the rest of what Mr. Kerry said: ''But I think it was the right vote based on what Saddam Hussein had done, and I think it was the right thing to do to hold him accountable. I've said 100 times, there was a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. The president chose the wrong way.''    COALITION       Mr. Bush said the war in Iraq was being waged by a large coalition; Mr. Kerry said that the coalition was shrinking and that eight countries had left it.     As of this month, 30 foreign countries had joined the United States, but they contribute only about 24,000 troops, with Britain supplying 8,000 of them. The United States has about 138,000 troops in Iraq, and 90 percent of the non-Iraqi casualties have been American.     Eight allied countries have withdrawn troops from Iraq since February: the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Norway, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain and Thailand.    AL QAEDA       Mr. Bush's statement in the first debate that 75 percent of Osama bin Laden's ''people have been brought to justice'' is impossible to document. It appears to refer to terrorist leaders, a loosely defined category.   There is no reliable tally of how many Qaeda operatives ever existed, and the administration has not provided the number who have been captured or killed.    DOMESTIC SECURITY      Mr. Kerry complained in the first debate that money spent on the war could be better used for police, firefighters and other security measures at home.     He said the administration had put ''not one nickel'' into protection for vulnerable tunnels, bridges and subways.     That is an exaggeration.     Even Democratic critics demanding more spending on rail and transit security and lobbyists for transit systems say the federal government has spent millions of dollars, while local transit authorities have spent more than a billion dollars.    Mr. Bush's statement that the administration had ''tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year'' was an  approximation and embroidered somewhat the rate of growth. It depends in part on what programs are counted, and from what date.     Money for programs inherited by the new Department of Homeland Security from other agencies has more than doubled since 2001, to about $24 billion in the fiscal year 2004, according to a report in April by the Congressional Budget Office.    Related programs in other agencies have grown almost as fast, bringing total domestic security spending to about $41 billion, a doubling since 2001.    Democrats have argued for even faster growth in spending on some of these programs.    IRAQ AND U.N. SANCTIONS      In the second debate, on Oct. 8, President Bush and Senator Kerry drew contradictory conclusions from the 918-page report issued this month by Charles A. Duelfer, the top American arms inspector in Iraq, and their interpretations did not always accurately reflect the report's findings.     After Mr. Kerry said that the Duelfer report had demonstrated that United Nations sanctions against Iraq ''worked,'' Mr. Bush said the report's lesson instead was that it was ''naïve and dangerous'' to ''just let the inspectors do their job.''     In fact, that report did not draw a firm conclusion about whether the sanctions and inspections succeeded in disarming Iraq. It said that Saddam Hussein's ''primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have U.N. sanctions lifted.'' But it also said that between 2000 and 2001, Iraq ''managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support.''     Mr. Bush referred to findings pointing to how porous the sanctions were and showing Iraq's success between 1991 and 2003 at circumventing the restrictions, primarily through imports of conventional weapons.    But Mr. Kerry emphasized what he portrayed as the restrictions' bottom-line success, in prompting what Mr. Duelfer said was the fundamental decision that Iraq made after the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 to set aside its plans for illicit weapons, at least for the time being, to win an end to sanctions.    JOBS      Mr. Kerry said in the second debate that Mr. Bush's was the first presidency in 72 years in which the number of jobs had fallen and that the nation had lost 1.6 million jobs since 2000. Mr. Bush said 1.9 million new jobs had been created in the last 13 months.     Mr. Kerry's figure for job losses counted only private-sector jobs. More than 1 million government jobs have been created. The total jobs lost has been about 585,000 through last month.     Mr. Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover to have had the number of jobs fall during his term. The nearly 2 million new jobs created in a little more than a year still leaves the administration in the hole.    TAXES AND THE BUDGET      Mr. Bush said in the third debate that most of the tax reduction in his presidency had gone ''to low- and middle-income Americans.''    In fact, Internal Revenue Service figures compiled by the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute show that half of all the tax cuts in effect this year go to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above about $112,000.    One-quarter of the cuts go to the richest 1 percent, those with incomes above about $357,000.    Mr. Bush also said the cuts were needed ''to get us out of the recession.'' But he proposed the cuts in his last presidential campaign, in 2000, before anyone knew that a recession was at hand, and he justified them by saying the surplus should be returned to the taxpayers.     The president said, as he often has elsewhere, that Mr. Kerry had voted for tax increases 98 times. That is probably true. But many, if not most, of those were multiple votes on the same bills or on nonbinding resolutions and motions. Mr. Kerry voted against the tax increase pushed by the president's father in 1990 to reduce the budget deficit. He voted for one large tax increase -- the Clinton bill of 1993, which imposed most of the increases on upper-income payers. Mr. Kerry said Mr. Bush had proposed $3 trillion in new spending, and Mr. Bush said Mr. Kerry had proposed $2 trillion. Neither claim can be proved, because the details of their proposals are so vague.    Mr. Kerry was correct when he said the budget had a projected $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office and now has large deficits for the foreseeable future.     But Mr. Kerry was not accurate when he said he had shown ''exactly how'' he intended to pay for all his spending proposals. In fact, he lists as additional revenues such vague promises as closing corporate loopholes and making the government more efficient.     The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that seeks deficit reduction, projects that Mr. Bush would cut taxes by $1.2 trillion in the coming decade, while Mr. Kerry would reduce revenues by $498 billion. New spending proposed by Senator Kerry would total $771 billion in the next decade, compared with $82 billion proposed by Mr. Bush.    BETTER OFF, WORSE OFF      Much of the third debate turned on the question of whether Americans had more money in their pockets as a result of President Bush's policies.     Mr. Kerry offered an array of statistics that in his view showed that people were worse off than they were at the beginning of the Bush presidency.     Mr. Bush accused his challenger of ''a litany of misstatements'' and held that voters were in better financial shape because of his tax cuts. But, as with the Kerry data, the accuracy of the president's statements is not obvious.     The truth seems to be that, after adjustments for inflation, Americans on average may have more money at their disposal. But more people are worse off than are better off.     The trick is in the word ''average.'' Average income -- all the income in the country divided by the total number of people -- has gone up because of the large increase in after-tax income enjoyed by the very wealthy.     But median income -- the point at which half the people have more and half less -- has dropped.    SOCIAL SECURITY, THE DRAFT      For weeks, the president attacked Mr. Kerry in ways that the Kerry campaign and outside commentators called distortions. After their last debate, Mr. Kerry began criticizing President Bush on Social Security and the draft in a manner that reached far beyond Mr. Bush's positions.     On Social Security, Mr. Kerry maintained that Mr. Bush planned a ''January surprise'' that could cost retirees up to 45 percent of their monthly checks. On the draft, Mr. Kerry said that involuntary extensions and National Guard call-ups amounted to a backdoor draft. He also told The Des Moines Register that there was ''the great potential of the draft'' if Mr. Bush won a second term.     Mr. Kerry's implication that people now retired stood to have their benefits cut was not fair. Mr. Bush has promised not to cut the Social Security benefits of current retirees or those nearing retirement age, and no plan under consideration would do that.     On the draft, Mr. Bush said flatly in the second debate that he had no plans to reinstate military conscription. There is hardly any political support for a draft, and the Pentagon is very much opposed to one.\",\n",
       " \"The Bush administration's well-deserved reputation for tailoring scientific information to fit its political agenda was reinforced last week when James Hansen, the government's pre-eminent climatologist, said that he had been instructed by Sean O'Keefe, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, not to discuss publicly the human contribution to global warming. The charge came as part of a broader indictment, delivered in a speech in Iowa, of the administration's refusal to confront the consequences of climate change or to do anything meaningful about reducing the industrial emissions that contribute to it.     NASA officials said that Mr. O'Keefe had no similar recollection and that Dr. Hansen may have misinterpreted a cautionary comment about the complexity of the issue as a direct order not to discuss it. But this administration has a depressing history of discouraging robust discourse on climate change. In 2002 and 2003, the White House censored reports from the Environmental Protection Agency discussing the risks of warming and linking it to human activity. A recent article by Andrew Revkin of The Times suggests that the selective use of evidence to suit predetermined policy goals began even earlier. In March 2001, for example, the White House chose a single, narrow economic analysis to help President Bush build his case that regulating greenhouse gas emissions, as required by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global climate change, would inflict unacceptable damage on the American economy. Meanwhile, other studies drawing more optimistic conclusions about industry's ability to limit emissions were swept under the rug.  \",\n",

A Kerry commercial titled ''January Surprise'' warns that ''Bush has a plan to cut Social Security benefits by 30 to 45 percent.''

In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen.

       " \"''Tort reform,'' the Bush administration's answer to the problem of high medical malpractice costs, makes sense from only one aspect: the political. The genius of tort reform, which focuses on putting a cap on the awards from malpractice suits, is that it offends only one big-money lobbying group: trial lawyers, who are important financial supporters of the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, it helps or holds harmless Republican special interests in the insurance, drug and health care industries. The only problem is that it hurts the hapless patients who suffer grievous harm at the hands of incompetent doctors.    We hold no brief for the current medical liability system, which does a poor job of compensating most victims of medical malpractice. An authoritative study of thousands of patients in New York State found that the vast majority who were harmed by medical errors or negligence never filed suit, whereas the vast majority of those who did file suit were not actually harmed by negligent doctors. Some studies suggest that, once a suit is filed, the courts do a reasonably good job of sorting out who deserves compensation, while other research has found that juries are swayed more by the severity of a plaintiff's injuries than by evidence of negligence. But in a medical system that is coming under increased fire for failing to deliver consistent quality in hospital care, it is clear that only a small number of people are being compensated for malpractice.   \",\n",

       " 'It was fascinating to watch President Bush lay out intelligent approaches to pressing problems at his news conference on Thursday night, and then urge Congress to pass bills that would do almost nothing to solve them. Social Security was one case in point, but another egregious example was energy, an issue that has moved to center stage in the White House because of public concern over high prices for oil and gasoline at the pump. Mr. Bush had trouble with this issue all week, beginning with an embarrassing effort to persuade the Saudis to gin up production. He then stumbled through an almost incoherent presentation of his larger energy strategy in a speech on Wednesday at a Small Business Administration conference.    Mr. Bush was more honest than his Democratic critics when he conceded that nothing would reduce gasoline prices in the short term except an agreement by the Saudis and others to turn on the spigot, a step that is not all that easy when global demand is pressing up against supply. He was also unusually forthright in saying that America must reduce its dependence on foreign oil, begin to wean itself from fossil fuels generally and invest in technology to get to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

       " \"Representatives of nearly 190 countries are currently meeting in New York to discuss ways of strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It's a shame that neither President Bush nor Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice can find time to attend. Nuclear proliferation is the pre-eminent national security issue of our times. The nonproliferation treaty, signed in 1968, is the main reason John F. Kennedy's nightmare vision of 15 to 20 nuclear weapons states has been avoided. Instead, there are fewer than 10: the five that already had nuclear weapons when the treaty was signed, and Israel, India, Pakistan and probably North Korea, with Iran threatening to join that list in a few years' time.     Israel developed its bomb in the 1960's, but India and Pakistan tested their first bombs in 1998, and North Korea could test at any time. These recent additions to the list are a clear sign that the treaty needs reinforcing, particularly by closing the loophole that now allows countries to legally acquire bomb-making skills and equipment under the guise of civilian nuclear power programs. That is the most important challenge facing this month's treaty review conference. But it cannot be met without committed leadership from the United States.  \",\n",

Within days, the White House reported the resignation of Paul Applegarth, the chief executive of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, who, with an entire world of poverty, disease and wretchedness to consider, managed to find only two countries worthy of aid. His office says his departure had ''absolutely'' nothing to do with the complaints lodged last week by the presidents of Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger and Namibia, who told Mr. Bush that the bureaucracy and fine print of the program made it nearly impossible for them to get aid. We're just glad Mr. Applegarth is going, and hope President Bush appoints a successor more interested in actually giving money to poor people.    To see just how badly the Millennium Challenge program has performed, compare it to the Fast Track Initiative for financing education, which is run out of the World Bank. Both programs came partly as a result of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, which commit all member countries to meet a set of quantifiable targets for combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women by 2015.

The Iraqi Army, despite Mr. Bush's optimistic descriptions, shows no signs of being able to control the country without American help for years to come. There are not enough American soldiers to carry out the job they have been sent to do, yet the strain of maintaining even this inadequate force is taking a terrible toll on the ability of the United States to defend its security on other fronts around the world.    We did not expect Mr. Bush would apologize for the misinformation that helped lead us into this war, or for the catastrophic mistakes his team made in running the military operation. But we had hoped he would resist the temptation to raise the bloody flag of 9/11 over and over again to justify a war in a country that had nothing whatsoever to do with the terrorist attacks. We had hoped that he would seize the moment to tell the nation how he will define victory, and to give Americans a specific sense of how he intends to reach that goal -- beyond repeating the same wishful scenario that he has been describing since the invasion.   \",\n",

Mr. Thomas is expected to get a euphemistically named ''retirement security'' bill to the House floor, perhaps by the end of the summer. The bill would include a proposal to establish private accounts, ostensibly with money diverted from the surplus in the Social Security trust fund. In reality, every penny of the trust fund is already promised for future benefits, so Congress would need to borrow the money to establish the accounts. As a result, the proposal would increase the budget deficit by some $80 billion next year and about $1 trillion over 10 years, based on numbers from Social Security's chief actuary.  \",\n",

       " \"When Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor of the eminent journal Science, was asked what had led so many American scientists to feel that George W. Bush's administration is anti-science, he isolated a familiar pair of culprits: climate change and stem cells. These represent, he said, ''two solid issues in which there is a real difference between a strong consensus in the science community and the response of the administration to that consensus.'' Both issues have in fact riled scientists since the early days of the administration, and both continue to have broad repercussions. In March 2001, the White House abruptly withdrew its support for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and the U.S. withdrawal was still a locus of debate at this summer's G8 summit in Scotland. And the administration's decision to limit federal funds for embryonic-stem-cell research four years ago -- a move that many scientists worry has severely hampered one of the most fruitful avenues of biomedical inquiry to come along in decades -- resulted in a shift in the dynamics of financing, from the federal government to the states and private institutions. In November 2004, Californians voted to allocate $3 billion for stem-cell research in what was widely characterized as a ''scientific secession.''     Yet what remains most divisive, according to Kennedy, is not the Bush administration's specific policies, but a more general sense that ''scientific conclusions, reached either within agencies or by people outside of government, are being changed for political reasons by people who have not done the scientific work.'' It is this sense that science is being ''misused'' that has given rise to two Congressional bills.  \",\n",

In an administration that has hated to acknowledge that it ever does anything wrong, it was refreshing to hear Mr. Bush freely admit that Katrina demonstrated that there is a question about whether the nation is really prepared to respond to a terrorist attack or another natural disaster. It is only by squarely acknowledging past failure that the country will be able to do better in the future.     The wording of the president's statement on Tuesday was important, and at least a bit worrisome. Mr. Bush accepted responsibility ''to the extent that the federal government didn't fully do its job right,'' which may suggest that he thinks the jury is still out on what the federal government's role should have been. Obviously, it will take time to completely analyze all of the federal system failures, and no one imagines that the city and state were perfectly prepared for the disaster.

       " \" ''Just Like Bush,'' a 30-second commercial for United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, began running on Friday on cable and network television stations in Philadelphia and New York.    PRODUCERS -- S.D.D. Media and Message & Media.    ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement begins with sinister music, and a narrator providing a voice-over to the text on the screen, and asking the rhetorical question, ''Who is the only candidate to raise property taxes 200 percent?'' A small moving image of the Republican candidate, Douglas R. Forrester, appears on the screen. The ad then shifts to a still photo in a purplish and pinkish hue of Mr. Forrester standing with President Bush, waving from Air Force One. As the narrator makes the argument that Mr. Forrester and Mr. Bush share the same agenda, various boldfaced statements scroll across the screen, as if hammered out by a typewriter. The ad concludes with the text in the biggest font yet, and on three lines: Doug Forrester George Bush's Choice for Governor Is He Yours?    THE SCRIPT -- ''Question: Who's the only candidate for governor who has raised property taxes? Answer: Doug Forrester. As a mayor and councilman, Forrester raised property taxes 200 percent. Now, just like George Bush, Forrester has proposed a tax plan that gives tax breaks to the wealthy, which will lead to deep cuts in education, health care, and emergency responders here in New Jersey. Doug Forrester: He's George Bush's choice for governor. Is he yours?''    ACCURACY -- It is true that Mr. Forrester raised property taxes 200 percent while he served as mayor and a councilman in West Windsor. But Mr. Forrester has said that he did so to pay for a sewer system, which in turn has increased property values -- something that people in West Windsor may feel was a worthwhile investment. Given the fact that Mr. Forrester has pledged not to raise property taxes, and does not seem inclined to tackle the thorny issues of school financing that academics say is at the heart of the state's high property taxes, it is hard to see how he could avoid at least some cuts to various programs, like education or health care.    SCORECARD -- Well, you can't accuse the Corzine campaign of being too original in this one. ''Just Like Bush'' uses the same material, essentially, from an earlier ad on Mr. Forrester's property tax record in the first 15 seconds, then uses the same material, basically, from another ad on the ties between Mr. Forrester and Mr. Bush for the remaining 15 seconds. And while such repetition reinforces the message that Mr. Corzine wants to get out, over and over and over again, this ad almost feels like political Tupperware: Mix together some perennial favorites, reheat it in a slightly different package, and hope that you satisfy as many people as you can.

The results give Hamas the right to form the next government, ending more than 40 years of domination by Fatah.

       " \"Ever since Washington began giving foreign aid, administrations have been coming up with plans to reform it. Now it's Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's turn. She has put a single official, reporting directly to her, in charge of coordinating the State Department's multiple foreign aid programs. Duplicate efforts are a problem, but they are not the main problem, and Ms. Rice's proposed solution could easily end up cutting programs that fight disease, send children to school or provide clean water.      Such basic antipoverty work is what most Americans would like our foreign aid to do. We know how to do it, and success is easy to measure. Yet the vast majority of overseas aid goes elsewhere. Economic aid for strategic allies and military aid make up more than half of the foreign aid budget. About 30 countries on the front line of the war on terror receive aid, mainly to buy their governments' support. Development assistance is only 30 percent of the budget, and a lot of that goes into projects undertaken in the name of promoting economic reform, democracy and good government. These are worthy causes -- but not ones that Washington is very good at doing. Nor is it easy to know what works.  \",\n",

       " 'Following is the transcript of President George W. Bush\\'s news conference on Iraq, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.BUSH: Thank you all very much. I\\'m going to spend a little more time on my opening comments than I usually do, but I\\'ll save plenty of time for questions. Over the past three years, I have often addressed the American people to explain developments in Iraq. Some of these developments were encouraging, such as the capture of Saddam Hussein, the elections in which 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and voted for a free future, and the demise of the brutal terrorist Zarqawi. Other developments were not encouraging, such as the bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, the fact that we did not find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, and the continued loss of some of America\\'s finest sons and daughters. Recently, American and Iraqi forces have launched some of the most aggressive operations on enemy forces in Baghdad since the war began. They have cleared neighborhoods of terrorists and death squads and uncovered large caches of weapons, including sniper scopes and mortars and powerful bombs. There had been heavy fighting. Many enemy fighters had been killed or captured. And we\\'ve suffered casualties of our own. This month we\\'ve lost 93 servicemembers in Iraq; the most since October of 2005. During roughly the same period, more than 300 Iraqi security personnel have given their lives in battle. Iraqi civilians have suffered unspeakable violence at the hands of the terrorists, insurgents, illegal militias, armed groups and criminals. The events of the past month have been a serious concern to me and a serious concern to the American people. Today I will explain how we\\'re adapting our tactics to help the Iraqi government gain control of the security situation. I will also explain why, despite the difficulties and bloodshed, it remains critical that America defeat the enemy in Iraq by helping the Iraqis build a free nation that can sustain itself and defend itself. Our security at home depends on ensuring that Iraq is an ally in the war on terror and does not become a terrorist haven like Afghanistan under the Taliban. The enemy we face in Iraq has evolved over the past three years. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, a sophisticated and violent insurgency took root. Early on, this insurgency was made up of remnants of Saddam Hussein\\'s Baath Party, as well as criminals released by the regime. The insurgency was fueled by Al Qaida and other foreign terrorists who focused most of their attention on high-profile attacks against coalition forces and international institutions. We learned some key lessons from that early phase in the war. We saw how quickly Al Qaida and other extremist groups would come to Iraq to fight and try to drive us out. We overestimated the capability of the civil service in Iraq to continue to provide essential services to the Iraqi people. We did not expect the Iraqi army, including the Republican Guard, to melt away in the way that it did in the face of advancing coalition forces. Despite these early setbacks, some very important progress was made in the midst of an incredibly violent period. Iraqis formed an interim government that assumed sovereignty. The Iraqi people elected a transitional government; drafted and adopted the most progressive democratic constitution in the Arab world; braved the car bombs and assassins to choose a permanent government under that constitution; and slowly began to build a capable national army. Al Qaida and insurgents were unable to stop this progress. They tried to stand up to our forces in places like Fallujah -- and they were routed, so they changed their tactics. In an intercepted letter to Osama bin Laden, the terrorist Zarqawi laid out his strategy to drag Iraq\\'s Shia population into a sectarian war. To the credit of the Shia population, they resisted; responding to the horrific violence against them for a long time. Yet the persistent attacks, particularly last February\\'s bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of the Shia Islam\\'s most holy shrines, eventually resulted in sectarian reprisals. The cycle of violence in which Al Qaida insurgents attacked Shia civilians and Shia death squads retaliated against Sunnis has sharply increased in recent months, particularly in Baghdad. As the enemy shifts tactics, we are shifting our tactics as well. Americans have no intention of taking sides in a sectarian struggle or standing in the crossfire between rival factions. Our mission is to help the elected government in Iraq defeat common enemies, to bring peace and stability to Iraq and make our nation more secure. Our goals are unchanging. We are flexible in our methods to achieving those goals. On the military side, our commanders on the ground are constantly adjusting our tactics to stay ahead of our enemies. We are refining our training strategy for the Iraqi security forces, so we can help more of those forces take the lead in the fight and provide them better equipment and firepower to be successful. We\\'ve increased the number of coalition advisers in the Iraqi ministries of defense and interior, so they can better plan and execute security operations against the enemy. We have changed our force structure so we can better respond to the conditions on the ground. For example, during the Iraqi elections, we increased our force levels to more than 150,000 troops to ensure people could vote. Most recently, we have moved additional coalition and Iraqi forces into Baghdad, so they can help secure the city and reduce sectarian violence. After some initial successes, our operations to secure Baghdad have encountered greater resistance. Some of the Iraqi security forces have performed below expectations. Many have performed well and are fighting bravely in some of Baghdad\\'s toughest neighborhoods. Once again, American troops are performing superbly under very difficult conditions. Together with the Iraqis, they\\'ve conducted hundreds of missions throughout Baghdad. They\\'ve rounded up or killed key insurgents and death squad leaders. As we fight this enemy, we are working with the Iraqi government to perform -- the performance -- to improve the performance of their security forces, so they can regain control of the nation\\'s capital and eventually assume primary responsibility for their country\\'s security. A military solution alone will not stop violence. In the end, the Iraqi people and their government will have to make the difficult decisions necessary to solve these problems. So, in addition to refining our military tactics to defeat the enemy, we\\'re also working to help the Iraqi government achieve a political solution that brings together Shia and Sunni and Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups. Yesterday, our ambassador to Iraq, Zal Khalilzad, laid out a three-step approach. First, we\\'re working with political and religious leaders across Iraq, urging them to take steps to restrain their followers and stop sectarian violence. Second, we\\'re helping Iraqi leaders to complete work on a national compact to resolve the most difficult issues dividing their country. The new Iraqi government has condemned violence from all quarters and agreed to a schedule for resolving issues such as disarming illegal militias and death squads, sharing oil revenues, amending the Iraqi constitution and reforming the de-Baathification process. Third, we are reaching out to Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan, asking them to support the Iraqi government\\'s efforts to persuade Sunni insurgents to lay down their arms and accept national reconciliation. The international community is also supporting the international compact that outlines the support that will be provided to Iraq as it moves forward with its own program of reform. These are difficult tasks for any government. It is important for Americans to recognize that Prime Minister Maliki\\'s unity government has been in office for just over five months. Think about that: This young government has to solve a host of problems created by decades of tyrannical rule, and they have to do it in the midst of raging conflict against extremists from outside and inside the country who are doing everything they can to stop this government from succeeding. We are pressing Iraqi\\'s leaders to take bold measures to save their country. We\\'re making it clear that America\\'s patience is not unlimited. Yet we also understand the difficult challenges Iraq\\'s leaders face. And we will not put more pressure on the Iraqi government than it can bear. The way to succeed in Iraq is to help Iraq\\'s government grow in strength and assume more control over its country as quickly as possible. I know the American people understand the stakes in Iraq. They want to win. They will support the war as long as they see a path to victory. Americans can have confidence that we will prevail because thousands of smart, dedicated military and civilian personnel are risking their lives and are working around the clock to ensure our success. A distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats, led by Former Secretary of State Jim Baker and Former Congressman Lee Hamilton, is taking a fresh look at the situation in Iraq and will make recommendations to help achieve our goals. I welcome all these efforts. My administration will carefully consider any proposal that will help us achieve victory. It\\'s my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. There is tough fighting ahead. The road to victory will not be easy. We should not expect a simple solution. The fact that the fighting is tough does not mean our efforts in Iraq are not worth it. To the contrary, the consequences in Iraq will have a decisive impact on the security of our country, because defeating the terrorists in Iraq is essential to turning back the cause of extremism in the Middle East. If we do not defeat the terrorists or extremists in Iraq, they will gain access to vast oil reserves and use Iraq as a base to overthrow moderate governments across the broader Middle East. They will launch new attacks on America from this new safe haven. They will pursue their goal of a radical Islamic empire that stretches from Spain to Indonesia. I know many Americans are not satisfied with the situation in Iraq. I\\'m not satisfied either. And that is why we\\'re taking new steps to help secure Baghdad and constantly adjusting our tactics across the country to meet the changing threat. But we cannot allow our dissatisfaction to turn into disillusionment about our purpose in this war. We must look at every success -- we must not look at every success of the enemy as a mistake on our part, cause for an investigation or a reason to call for our troops to come home. We must not fall prey to the sophisticated propaganda by the enemy, who is trying to undermine our confidence and make us believe that our presence in Iraq is the cause of all its problems. If I did not think our mission in Iraq was vital to America\\'s security, I\\'d bring our troops home tomorrow. I\\'ve met too many wives and husbands who\\'ve lost their partners in life; too many children who won\\'t ever see their mom and dad again. I owe it to them and to the families who still have loved ones in harm\\'s way to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. Our country\\'s faced adversity before during times of war. In past wars, we\\'ve lost young Americans who gave everything to protect our freedom and way of life. In this war, we\\'ve lost good men and women who\\'ve given their lives for a cause that is necessary and it is just. We mourn every loss. And we must gird ourselves for the sacrifices that are yet to come. America\\'s men and women in uniform are the finest in the world. I\\'m awed by their strength and their character. As General Casey reported yesterday in Iraq, the men and women of the armed forces have never lost a battle in over three years in the war. Every American can take pride in our troops and the vital work they are doing to protect us. Our troops are fighting a war that will set the course for this new century. The outcome will determine the destiny of millions across the world. Defeating the terrorists and extremists is the challenge of our time and the calling of this generation. I\\'m confident this generation will answer that call and defeat and ideology that is bent on destroying America and all that we stand for. And now I\\'ll be glad to answer some of your questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, the war in Iraq has lasted almost as long as World War II for the United States. And as you mentioned, October was the deadliest month for American forces this year -- in a year. Do you think we\\'re winning, and why? BUSH: First of all, this is a different kind of war than a war against the fascists in World War II. We were facing a nation state -- two nation states -- three nation states in World War II. We were able to find an enemy by locating its ships or aircraft or soldiers on the ground. This is a war against extremists and radicals who kill innocent people to achieve political objectives. It has a multiple of fronts. Afghanistan was a front in this war against the terrorists. Iraq is now the central front in the war against the terrorists. This war is more than just finding people and bringing them to justice. This war is an ideological conflict between a radical ideology that can\\'t stand freedom and moderate, reasonable people that hope to live in a peaceful society. And so it\\'s going to take a long time. I am confident we will succeed. I am confident we\\'ll succeed in Iraq. And the reason I\\'m confident we\\'ll succeed in Iraq is because the Iraqis want to succeed in Iraq. The ultimate victory in Iraq, which is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself, depends upon the Iraqi citizens and the Iraqi government doing the hard work necessary to protect their country. And our job is to help them achieve that objective. As a matter of fact, my view is: The only way we lose in Iraq is if we leave before the job is done. And I\\'m confident we can succeed in the broader war on terror, this ideological conflict. I\\'m confident because I believe the power of liberty will defeat the ideology of hate every time, if given a chance. I believe that the radicals represent the few in the Middle East. I believe the majority of people want to live in a peaceful world. That\\'s what I believe. And I know it\\'s incumbent upon our government, and others who enjoy the blessings of liberty, to help those moderates succeed. Because otherwise we\\'re looking at the potential of this kind of world, a world in which radical forms of Islam compete for power; a world in which moderate governments get toppled by people willing to murder the innocent; a world in which oil reserves are controlled by radicals in order to extract blackmail from the West; a world in which Iran has a nuclear weapon. And if that were to occur, people would look back at this day and age and say, What happened to those people in 2006? How come they couldn\\'t see the threat to a future generation of people? Defeat will only come is the United States becomes isolationist and refuses to, one, protect ourselves; and, two, help those who desire to become -- to live in a moderate, peaceful world. And it\\'s a hard struggle; no question about it. And it\\'s a different struggle. QUESTION: Are we winning? BUSH: Absolutely we\\'re winning. Al Qaida\\'s on the run. As a matter of fact, the mastermind, or the people who they think is the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks, is in our custody. We\\'ve now got a procedure for this person to go on trial, to be held for his account. Most of Al Qaida that planned the attacks on September the 11th have been brought to justice. Extremists have now played their hand. The world can clearly see their ambitions. You know, when a Palestinian state began to show progress, extremists attacked Israel, to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. They can\\'t stand democracies. Extremists and radicals want to undermine fragile democracy because it\\'s a defeat for their way of life, their ideology. People now understand the stakes. We\\'re winning and we will win, unless we leave before the job is done. And the crucial battle, right now, is Iraq. And as I said in my statement, I understand how tough it is, really tough. It\\'s tough for a reason, because people understand the stakes of success in Iraq. And my point to the American people is that we\\'re constantly adjusting our tactics to achieve victory. QUESTION: Are you considering sending more U.S. troops to Iraq? What would be the justification for it? And how reliable is this new timetable of 12 to 18 months? BUSH: The -- I will send more troops to Iraq if General Casey says, \"I need more troops in Iraq to achieve victory.\" And that\\'s the way I\\'ve been running this war. I have great faith in General Casey. I have great faith in Ambassador Khalilzad. I trust our commanders on the ground to give the best advice about how to achieve victory. I want to remind you, victory is a government that can sustain itself, govern -- it\\'s a country that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself and serves as an ally in the war on terror -- which stands in stark contrast to a government that would be chaotic, that would be a safe haven for the enemy to launch attacks on us. One way for the American people to understand what Iraq could look like is what Afghanistan looked like under the Taliban -- a place where there was no freedom, a place where women were taken to the public square and beaten if they did not adhere to the strict, intolerant guidelines of the Taliban, a place where thousands trained to attack America and our allies. Afghanistan doesn\\'t have nearly the resources that Iraq has. Imagine a safe haven for an enemy that ended up with the resources that it had. And so this is a war where I say to our generals, Do you have what it takes to win? Now, General Casey talked about part of our strategy. And part of the strategy is to give the Iraq government the tools necessary to protect itself, to defend itself. If you\\'re able to defend yourself, you\\'re more likely to be able to govern yourself, as well. But politics, the political way forward, and the military way forward, must go hand in hand. And what the general was saying yesterday is that there is a three-step process to enable the Iraqi forces to be able to help this government bring security. One was to train and equip. The goal is 325,000 troops -- 137,000 military and the balance police. Second was to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead. Six of 10 divisions now are in the lead in helping this government defend itself. The strategy has been to embed U.S. personnel, officers and noncomm. officers, into these forces to help them gain the confidence and the capacity to be effective when they\\'re in the lead. And the third step is for the Iraqi security forces to be able to operate independently. And this, perhaps, is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of having the Iraqis ready to go, because that means they have to be able to drive themselves, maintain their vehicles, provide logistics, have a combat service support. And that\\'s what General Casey was describing. The key is that our commanders feel that they have got enough flexibility to design the program to meet the conditions on the ground. You know, last spring, I thought for a period of time we\\'d be able to reduce our troop presence early next year. That\\'s what I felt. But because we didn\\'t have a fixed timetable and because General Casey and General Abizaid and the other generals there understand that the way we\\'re running this war is to give them flexibility, have the confidence necessary to come and make the recommendations here in Washington, D.C., they decided that that wasn\\'t going to happen. So what he was describing to you was the way forward, to make sure that the Iraqis are fully prepared to defend themselves. QUESTION:  Now, again, I understand how -- look, I read -- look at the newspapers around here. I can see why you think that, you know, I\\'m concealing something in my heart of hearts. The race is over as far as a lot of the punditry goes. You know, they\\'ve got it all figured out. And they just -- as I said, they\\'re dancing in the end zone. They just hadn\\'t scored the touchdown. You know, there\\'s a lot of time left. And these candidates are working hard out there. And my message to them is: Keep talking about the security of the United States and keeping taxes low, and you\\'ll come back here. Last question. QUESTION: Back in 2000, you campaigned around the country, saying you wanted to usher in the responsibility era, to end the days when people said: If it feels good, do it; and, if you\\'ve got a problem, blame somebody else. BUSH: Right. QUESTION: Over the last several months, we\\'ve seen many members of your own party in Congress embroiled in one scandal or another, and all too ready to blame somebody else, whether prosecutors or Democrats or even the media. So I\\'m wondering: Why do you think it is so many people in your own party have failed to live up the standards of the responsibility era? BUSH: If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account. It\\'s important for there to be trust in the halls of Congress and in the White House and throughout government. People have got to trust elected leaders in order for democracy to work to its fullest extent. And I fully expect, you know, people to be held to account if there\\'s wrong-doing; just like I expect corporate executives to be held to account for wrong-doing, just like I expect people throughout our society to be held to account for wrong-doing. People do have to take responsibility for the decisions they make in life. I take responsibility for the decisions I make. I also understand that those of us in positions of responsibility have the duty to bring, you know, honor to the offices we hold. People don\\'t have to agree with somebody\\'s opinion. There\\'s all kinds of opinions here. But in order to make this country work and to make democracy succeed, there\\'s got to be high standards and people must be held to account to achieve those standards. I thank you for your time. See you on the campaign trail. ',\n",

       " 'With the title of his 1980 book, the journalist Sidney Blumenthal coined a term that has entered the political lexicon: “The Permanent Campaign.” The phrase denotes the blurring of the line in modern times between campaigning and governing. Presidents, of course, have always made decisions with an eye on their popularity. But with the advent of television, polling, and professional consultants, presidents of the 1970s and ’80s—Nixon, Carter, and Reagan in particular—upped the ante by devoting the full arsenal of modern electioneering tools not just to winning office but to holding office as well.Recently, the permanent campaign has added yet another stage—a final frontier. This is the fight for history, centered on the presidents’ libraries. The presidential libraries date from 1939, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt conceived his as a repository for his public papers, to be built with private funds and run by public officials. Since then, chief executives have sought to outdo their predecessors by entombing their archives in extravagant, self-memorializing shrines. These museums extend the permanent campaign by utilizing the same public relations techniques as a race for the White House—and lately requiring comparable fundraising efforts to boot.',\n",
       " 'B rad Pitt was emotional but calm and Angelina Jolie  laughed and chatted during the birth of their twins, a boy and a girl. All \"are doing marvelously well,\" according to the doctor who delivered the babies in a seaside hospital on the French Riviera. The babies, Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline , were born one minute apart. For now, mother, father and newborns are resting out of the public eye on the fifth floor of the Lenval hospital, behind windows specially treated to deflect photography. Jolie\\'s obstetrician, Dr. Michel Sussmann , said Pitt, 44, was at Jolie\\'s side Saturday evening during the delivery, looking on as Sussmann performed a Caesarean section. \"He was my assistant,\" the doctor joked. Sussmann said the Caesarean was moved forward from its planned date \"for medical reasons\" so the babies could be born \"in the best conditions.\" He said Jolie, 33, was expected to stay in the hospital for a few more days and that she now needed rest. Nice-Matin, a daily in the Riviera city in the south of France, put the worth of the twins\\' photos at more than $11 million. It broke news of the birth and reported Sunday that the couple had sold the rights for the first photo of their expanded family to a U.S. publication, which it did not name, and that the proceeds would go to charity.',\n",
